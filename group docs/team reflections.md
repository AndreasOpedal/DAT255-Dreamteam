# Team Reflection week 4, Monday 23/4
**the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now:* We’ve started creating User Stories, now we have User stories that are more or less useful, but they have not been evaluated with the INVEST criteria yet and are therefore not broken down into tasks. We did present the user stories to the end user representatives, but we did not manage to present them to the product owner as there was no time on the supervision meeting. 

*Goa:l* To present our user stories to the product owners on wednesday. Also to create a prioritized list containing user stories and start breaking down and work on each user story.

*Gap:* Making sure we get a meeting with the Product owners, since we didn’t manage to last week. We also need to make sure that we all sit down together to take care of the user story situaton and evaluating it with the INVEST criteria.  

**your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now:*  Have updated the social contract so that one person is responsible for uploading the group reflection.

*Goal:* To have a social contract that all group members are satsified with and follow. 

*Gap:*  Test how well the current iteration of the social contract is at creating an evenly distributed workload among the team members.

**success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

*Now:* Since we weren’t able to meet with the Product owner due to lack of time (and too much people) we have yet to present our current situation and User Stories to the Product Owners. 

*Goal:* Determine the success criteria in consultation with the product owner.

*Gap:* Meet with the product owner and present a draft of prioritizations which we as a group have identified.

**your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

*Now:* We have not yet generated any code on which to conduct acceptance tests.

*Goal:* Create our first acceptance tests once code is in place. 

*Gap:* Generate code that we can test.

**the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

*Now:*  We have now acquired a basic knowledge about Javascript and React Native. 

*Goal:* Have a enough understanding about the structure behind the current application.

*Gap:* Implement our knowledge about React Native into code (we are like Jon Snow, we know nothing, sorry).

**the behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

*Now:* We have a basic understanding of how the PortableCDM app works and how users interact with it. We understand the needs of the user and have created a hypothesis on behavior and evaluated our own experience in order to make changes in the design of the app.

*Goal:* Understand how to create and implement a notification function into the application

*Gap:* Two or three people are responsible for searching information about creating notifications in React Native, and should be able to inform the rest of the group about this during next week’s meeting. 

**the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

*Now:* We do not yet have an understanding of the general (main) application presented.

*Goal:* The goal is to acquire a good enough understanding of the structure so that we can 
present a roadmap of how the different classes interact with each other. 

*Gap:* Delegate the task of acquiring this understanding to one or two project members which they will present to the rest of the group during the week. 

**your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

*Now:* We have started the process of creating user stories but have not yet prioritized them We have had two meetings with the pilot and gotten a better understanding of the main application. We haven’t presented our user stories to the product owner. 

*Goal:* Have a preliminary and prioritized set of user stories, some of which are broken down into tasks. Come up with an acceptance criteria together with the product owners.

*Gap:* A smaller group of people are responsible for prioritizing the set of user stories and create acceptance criterias which are to be presented to the product owners on wednesday.


**the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

*Now:* We have established three KPI’s and have used them for three sprints, we have also discussed if they are still relevant for tracking our process and concluded that they are good enough. There are other alternatives to the time-tracking (Overhead) KPI, but the group have decided that we will stick with the original one during at least one sprint containing coding in order to assess it fairly. For the velocity KPI, we fell short this sprint as well... 

*Goal:* Have three KPI’s that contribute to facilitating good communication, maximizing time spent on value-contributing activities and accurate assessment of our own velocity. Further assess the Overhead KPI during the following sprint. 

*Gap:* For the Velocity KPI: Important to divide user stories into smaller tasks that are easier to estimate. Generally: continue to evaluate the KPI’s during the sprint retrospectives. Keep tracking the Overhead KPI during next week’s review meeting.

**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now:* We do not have code to test yet.

*Goal:* To learn more on working with one person testing another persons code.

*Gap:* Be at a stage where we write code and then test the generated code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now:* We have assigned the following role: Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible, responsible for Trello, reminding-of-indiviudal-reflection and uploading team reflection responsible, responsible for contact with course examiner and Git-responsible.

*Goal:* Equal share of work to each person in the project.

*Gap:* Early stage of the project with limited amount of work to assign. Better role descriptions need to be formulated for future efforts.

**the agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now:* We are in the state that we are comfortable enough to use and set up User Stories in Trello. We have also created another group chat in able to separate “informative” information and formal information regarding the application/development. We have also implemented daily scrums for every time all of us in the project group meet (2-3 days a week)


*Goal:* Break down the group into more individual task in order to become more effective.

*Gap:* Assign specific tasks to smaller groups and set deadlines for when that group should be done with their task and inform the rest of the group.

**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now:* Last sprint we spent on average 15 hours. This was because of a lack of having value-adding assignments. 

*Goal:* Get on track towards a 20 hrs average for the end of the course.

*Gap:* We need to input more hours in the coming weeks to reach the 20 hour average. This is a conscious strategy though, as we want to be able to spend more time when there is more programming to do. 

**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now:* We have established a standard procedure for conducting the sprint reviews. 

*Goal:* That the product owner is satisfied with the user stories we have produced. 

*Gap:* Prioritize user stories, create acceptance criterias and present them to the product owners

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now:* We have found a suitable IDE to work with: Sublime. We have developed a best practice for using Git and GitHub that all group members will follow when coding. Android Studio has been set up for all but one of the group members. We have started looking at Javascript and React Native. All but one group members have set up the development environment. 

*Goal:* As one of the user stories is to implement a notification function, the goal is now to understand the technologies (classes etc) associated with implementing this. 

*Gap:* Solve the setup issues with Android Studio for the last PC user in our group by providing the person with the information the others have learned when setting up the developer environment. We want to search the web for more information regarding notification functions in javascript, this will be done in smaller groups.




**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

*Now:* Since we haven’t had any lectures there is no new information to collect from guest lectures. We have had a meeting with the examiners in the course where we discussed the process, which was helpful in creating this reflection.We still find it very hard to adapt the agile way of working, because we find ourselves wanting to plan for everything ahead. 


*Goal:* To mentally adapt the agile way of working, i.e. learning how to tackle assignments without having complete knowledge in advance. 

*Gap:* Just continue doing it! Help each other during the group meetings to mention that we don’t need a complete understanding of something in order to start to do it. 

# Team Reflection week 3, Monday 16/4
**the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now* We have had our first meeting with the pilot station

*Goal* To have a list of user stories in prioritized order that can easily be broken down into tasks

*Gap* Process information from first meeting with pilot, develop user stories and ideas and prioritize features in the application before the second meeting with the pilot. Present user stories to end user representative as well as product owner. 

**your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now*  Have updated the social contract with how the daily scrums work and how the time log is structured. 

*Goal* To have a social contract that all group members are satsified with and follow. 

*Gap*  Test how well the current iteration of the social contract is at creating an evenly distributed workload among the team members.

**success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

*Now* We have met our pilot and have an overall overview of what will be important in the application. We have not yet met with the product owner to determine success criterias. 

*Goal* Determine the success criteria from the Product Owner

*Gap* Meet with the product owner and present a draft of prioritizations wich we as a group has identified.

**your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

*Now* We have not yet generated any code on which to conduct acceptance tests.

*Goal* Create our first acceptance tests once code is in place. 

*Gap* Generate code that we can test.

**the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

*Now*  We have started looking into the design of the given PortCDM application and gained a basic understanding of how it works

*Goal* Have a good enough understanding so that we start developing the application

*Gap* Learn about React Native

**the behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

*Now* We have a basic understanding of how the PortableCDM app works and how users interact with it. 

*Goal* Make incremental adjustments to the app as it is used today.

*Gap* Understand the needs of the user in order to create a hypothesis on behavior and evaluate our own experience to make changes in the design of the app. 

**the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

*Now* We do not yet have an understanding of the general (main) application presented.

*Goal* We choose to not gain a deep understanding of the structural overview of the whole app. The goal is therefore to get a good enough understanding of the classes we are interacting with to make the changes we want to do. 

*Gap* Find those specific classes that we need to use in order to create value for our product owners. 

**your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

*Now* We only have a foundation towards user stories, and not yet any “real” user stories that we can start breaking down into tasks.

*Goal* Have a preliminary and prioritized set of user stories.

*Gap* Create user stories, prioritize them, meet with Pilot, present user stories to product owner,  get familiar with main application.


**the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

*Träffsäkerhet i Velocity - hur väl uppskattar vi vår velocity?*

Hur: Genom att uppskatta tid (mantimmar) som gruppen kan avsätta, och använda detta som initial velocity.
Nuläge: Vi har inte kunnat arbeta ännu i projekt och kan därför inte uppskatta vår träffsäkerhet. 
Mål: Vårt mål är att ligga inom 30% av vår uppskattade Velocity.
Strategi: Efter varje sprint anpassar vi detta mått och stämmer av hur väl detta sätt att mäta velocity stämmer överens med vår faktiska Velocity.

Värde: -
We do not yet have any user stories that we can work with and use to assess our current velocity.


*Kommunikation - hur väl fungerar vår kommunikation i gruppen?*

Hur: Transparens: Hur ärliga har vi varit mot varandra gällande vårt behov av hjälp, tillgänglig tid.
Tydlighet: Hur väl har vi lyckats förmedla information till gruppen, hur “rak” har kommunikationen varit.
Frekvens: Har vi kommunicerat tillräckligt frekvent och i tid?
KPI:n sätts genom att medlemmarna betygsätter kommunikationen i gruppen med ett sammanvägt betyg på en skala 1-5 med en kort motivation till betyget.
Nuläge: Vi har inledningsvis haft brister i skriftlig kommunikation, vad som gåtts igenom, framförallt under möten. Detta påverkade inte de som deltog på plats på mötet men blev tydligt för de som fick delta över Skype.
Mål: Vårt mål är att hålla en hög genomsnittlig nivå på kommunikationen över veckorna med ett snitt över 4.5 av 5.
Strategi: Genom att stämma av i slutet av varje sprint och betygsätta kommunikationen enligt ovan.


Kommentarer: Vi behöver bli bättre på team reflections.


*Overhead - hur stor andel av vår tid är värdeadderande för produktägaren?*

Hur: KPI:n mäts som tid vi lägger ned per vecka minus mötestid och tid lagd på reflektioner genom total tid som lagts ned i projektet.
Nuläge: I nuläget har ingen kod presterats och ingen produktägare presenterats.
Mål: Vårt mål med nuvarande definition är att hålla oss 30% - 50%
Strategi: Genom att stämma av efter varje sprint justerar vi för att se vad som varit icke värdeadderande tid och vad som varit värdeadderande för att iterativt närma oss vad som faktiskt är värdeadderande och på så sätt kunna arbeta för att minska det som inte tillför värde till projektet.


*Now* We have established three KPI’s and have used them for two sprints.

*Goal* Have three KPI’s that contribute to facilitating good communication, maximizing time spent on value-contributing activities and accurate assessment of our own velocity.

*Gap* For the Velocity KPI:Divide user stories into smaller tasks that are easier to estimate. Generally: continue to evaluate the KPI’s during the sprint retrospectives. 

**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now* We do not have code to test yet.

*Goal* To learn more on working with one person testing another persons code.

*Gap* Be at a stage where we write code and then test the generated code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now* We have assigned the following role: Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible, responsible for Trello, reminding-of-indiviudal-reflection responsible, responsible for contact with course examiner and Git-responsible.

*Goal* Equal share of work to each person in the project.

*Gap* Early stage of the project with limited amount of work to assign. Better role descriptions need to be formulated for future efforts.

**the agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now* We have all the theory needed to implement agile practices (through Scrum) for the project. We discussed moving the sprints from monday-monday to wednesday-wednesday since this was some feedback we got from our meeting with Jean-Philippe. We have decided to keep the monday-monday since we want to have the sprint planning the same day as the sprint retrospective and team reflection. If we were to move it to wednesday-wednesday we wouldn't have time to adjust our next sprint planning the same day after meeting the product owners, since we only have group meetings on mondays and wednesdays.

*Goal* In general we want to apply Scrum in an efficient way that works well for our project group. A goal right now however is to consistently use Trello (as a Scrumboard) throughout the sprint. 

*Gap* For Trello: Set up user stories and tasks for the sprint in Trello and then move all the tasks that are completed to the next “step”.

**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now* Most of the group members have spent more than 20 hours the last sprint, as we had problems with setting up the development environment. 

*Goal* Get on track toward a 20 hrs average for the end of the course.

*Gap* We need to input more hours in the coming weeks to reach the 20hour average. This is a conscious strategy though, as we want to be able to spend more time when there is more programming to do. 

**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now* We have established a standard procedure for conducting the sprint reviews. 

*Goal* That the product owner is satisfied with the user stories we have produced. 

*Gap* Make user stories, prioritize them and present them to the product owners

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now* We have found a suitable IDE to work with: Sublime. We have developed a best practice for using Git and GitHub that all group members will follow when coding. Android Studio is still in setup stage for half of the group. There are no best practices yet for Javascript and React Native. 

*Goal* To get a clearer view of how Android Studio works and how we as a group should use it when developing. We should also have a greater understanding of Javascript and the React Native framework.

*Gap* Solve the setup issues with Android Studio for the PC users in the group. Also gain a knowledge base for Javascript, both through theory and learning by doing in the development project. 

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

*Now* We have implemented daily Scrum in our practices. In relation to guest lectures, Mikael spoke a lot about how agile practices advocates doing incremental changes and consistenly moving forward in the project. From most courses at Chalmers we have learned that the opposite oftentimes works best - preparing and studying before implementing that is. We are confused by this paradox. 

*Goal* To mentally adapt the agile way of working, i.e. learning how to tackle assignments without having complete knowledge in advance. 

*Gap* Just do it!™ 


# Team Reflection week 2, Thursday 29/3
**the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now* We have established three KPI’s.

*Goal* Have three KPI’s that contribute to facilitating good communication, maximizing time spent on value-contributing activities and accurate assessment of our own velocity. 

*Gap* We are not yet at a stage where all three KPI’s can be fully tested. We will evaluate these KPI’s after each sprint during our retrospective.

**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now* We do not have code to test yet.

*Goal* Läsa in sig på Findbugs och liknande program

*Gap* Gain knowledge of code testing.

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now* We have assigned roles, among others, Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible.

*Goal* Equally share of work to each person in the project.

*Gap* Early stage of the project with limited amount of work to assign. Better role descriptions need to be formulated for future efforts.

**the agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now*  We have completed our first sprint. In our second sprint we have broken down the scenario provided into a timeline for a vessel on approach to the port of Gothenburg

*Goal* Gain a better understanding of agile practices and apply them.

*Gap* Read up on agile practices in software development as well as attend lectures in the course to further our knowledge on agile work practices.

**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now* This week consisted of a shorter sprint. Currently all members short of the 20 hrs goal. Major goals for the sprint achieved regarding knowledge gains.

*Goal* Get on track toward a 20 hrs average for the end of the course.

*Gap* At the moment all project members are short of this goal.

**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now* We have met with the product owners and asked initial general questions regarding scope and expectations. Much is yet to be known on what is needed in the final product. We feel a need to gain a deeper understanding of the application before we can start generating our own code.

*Goal* Have a standard for how we do the sprint reviews

*Gap* Discuss among us how we want to do the sprint reviews at next meeting.

**best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Gap* Find suitable IDE, develop skills working with Git and Trello.

**relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say**

*Now* We are still in the early stages of trying to apply Scrum to our workflow. Much is confusing, it is difficult to adhere to the processes and “rules” laid out by The Scrum Guide as this is new to us. Scrum rules formulated and to be reviewed for our next meeting.


*Goal* Continue to develop and learn the processes of agile development.

*Gap* Read up more on Scrum and how we can apply these processes in our project. 


# Team Reflection week 1, Thursday 22/3

**The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now*
Due to limited information about the project and its scope, it is impossible to tell at this stage.

*Goal*
The goal is to gain enough knowledge about the project and expectations of the project owner to be able to define the chosen scope of the application.

*Gap*
Through lectures, literature and conversations with the product owner we will get further insight into the project and what features should be prioritized in the application. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now*
During the first week a first draft of a social contract was created containing specifications such as; members and email addresses, meeting schedule, rules on attendance, responsibilities and roles, time log policy, documentation policy and ambition levels.

*Goal*
Since we are currently lacking information regarding the project, we were unable to complete the social contract. Next week we will therefore add new roles and responsibilities and more detailed description of scrum rules and sprint techniques. 

*Gap*
To be able to fill this weeks information gap we need to attend lectures on scrum techniques and discuss our take on it. We will also review the course literature to see if we can find more information on working with scrum. By attending the project introduction lecture (next week) we will hopefully get a fuller picture of the project scope and will then be able to adjust the social contract correctly.

The following points we are not yet able to define since the information hasn’t been reviewed this early in the course. Our goal is to fill in the gaps by attending lectures and gaining knowledge from course literature and information from the project owner:

* **The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

* **Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

* **The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

* **The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

* **The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

* **Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

* **The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

* **Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

**The roles you have used within the team
***Now*
In our first week we have assigned some roles to our team members including Scrum master, secretary for meetings, a casting vote, a chief location officer (CLO). 

*Goal*
To have a relevant task assigned for every member, but still an equal amount of work.

*Gap*
To reach our goal we will have to learn about which relevant tasks that exists in a project of this format and have responsibilities that require somewhat equal efforts for a fair workload. **
**

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now*
In the first week our team had initially limited experiences of agile practices, both about what it is and how it should be adopted in an IT project. 

*Goal*
To get acquainted with and use Scrum during the project. 

*Gap*
We will learn the agile practices by going to the lectures as well as reading literatures about useful practices that we can try and evaluate. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now*
We have created a table where we keep records of the time spent on this course.   

*Gap*
Hard to reach 20h/week in the first week since we haven’t been introduced to the application. This week we have spent the time on lectures and learning git/scrum practices, around 12 hours in total as a group as of thursday, first week. 

*Goal*
Reach 20h/week for every member which will be audited every week.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

In this section we’re considering this weeks LEGO exercise

*Now*
We tried to asses out team velocity and the scope of the user stories.

*Goal*
Our goal is to become better at assessing velocity and scope of the user stories.

*Gap*
Live activity based training (aka learning by doing).

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now*
We have started using GitHub, Git as well as Trello.

*Goal*
Learn how to use the tools efficiently and according to best practices.

*Gap*
Initially learning by doing. Further down the road we will consult online guides and other available resources.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We have not yet had any guest lectures or read any course literature.

 We do not yet have an application/known behavior that we can get a behavorial overview of.
*Goal*
 Get to know how our application can best be used
*Gap*
 Understand the needs of the user in order to create a hypothesis on behavior.
the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)
*Now*
 We do not yet have an understanding of the general application presented. Förstå strutkur på rådande API och app
*Goal*
 Gain an understanding 
*Gap*

your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
*Now*
 
*Goal*
 Ta fram UX
*Gap*

the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress


Träffsäkerhet i Velocity - hur väl uppskattar vi vår velocity?
Hur: Genom att uppskatta tid (mantimmar) som gruppen kan avsätta, och använda detta som initial velocity.
Nuläge: Vi har inte kunnat arbeta ännu i projekt och kan därför inte uppskatta vår träffsäkerhet. 
Mål: Vårt mål är att ligga inom 30% av vår uppskattade Velocity.
Strategi: Efter varje sprint anpassar vi detta mått och stämmer av hur väl detta sätt att mäta velocity stämmer överens med vår faktiska Velocity.

Värde: -
We do not yet have any user stories that we can work with and use to assess our current velocity.

Kommunikation - hur väl fungerar vår kommunikation i gruppen?
Hur: Transparens: Hur ärliga har vi varit mot varandra gällande vårt behov av hjälp, tillgänglig tid.
Tydlighet: Hur väl har vi lyckats förmedla information till gruppen, hur “rak” har kommunikationen varit.
Frekvens: Har vi kommunicerat tillräckligt frekvent och i tid?
KPI:n sätts genom att medlemmarna betygsätter kommunikationen i gruppen med ett sammanvägt betyg på en skala 1-5 med en kort motivation till betyget.
Nuläge: Vi har inledningsvis haft brister i skriftlig kommunikation, vad som gåtts igenom, framförallt under möten. Detta påverkade inte de som deltog på plats på mötet men blev tydligt för de som fick delta över Skype.
Mål: Vårt mål är att hålla en hög genomsnittlig nivå på kommunikationen över veckorna med ett snitt över 4 av 5.
Strategi: Genom att stämma av i slutet av varje sprint och betygsätta kommunikationen enligt ovan.


Kommentarer: Vi behöver bli bättre på team reflections.
Värde: 4,625


Overhead - hur stor andel av vår tid är värdeadderande för produktägaren?
Hur: KPI:n mäts som tid vi lägger ned per vecka minus mötestid och tid lagd på reflektioner genom total tid som lagts ned i projektet.
Nuläge: I nuläget har ingen kod presterats och ingen produktägare presenterats.
Mål: Vårt mål med nuvarande definition är att hålla oss under 50%
Strategi: Genom att stämma av efter varje sprint justerar vi för att se vad som varit icke värdeadderande tid och vad som varit värdeadderande för att iterativt närma oss vad som faktiskt är värdeadderande och på så sätt kunna arbeta för att minska det som inte tillför värde till projektet.


*Now*
 Overhead etc.. our three KPIs
*Goal*
 Utvärde värdet av varje KPI - ändras? Prestera så bra som möjligt efter KPI’erna 
*Gap*
 
code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself
*Now*
 Har ej börjat skriva kod
*Goal*
 Läsa in sig på Findbugs och liknande program
*Gap*
 
the roles you have used within the team
*Now*
 We have assigned roles, among others, Scrummaster, responsible of booking group rooms, secretary and meeting protocol responsible.
*Goal*
 Få tydligare rollbeskrivningar - någon ska skriva
*Gap*
 
the agile practices you have used for the current sprint
*Now*
  We have completed our first sprint. In our second sprint we have broken down the scenario provided into a timeline for a vessel on approach to the port of Gothenburg
*Goal*
 Gain a better understanding of agile practices and apply them.
*Gap*
 Read up on agile practices in software development as well as attend lectures in the course to further our knowledge on agile work practices.
the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
*Now*
 kortare sprint denna veckan => färre timmar (ca 10 per perrson antar jag?)
*Goal*
 Jobba ikapp så att vi ligger på ett snitt på 20h i slutet av kursen
*Gap*
 Ligger back i antal timmar
the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)
*Now*
 We have met with the product owners and asked initial general questions regarding scope and expectations. Much is yet to be known on what is needed in the final product. We feel a need to gain a deeper understanding of the application before we can start generating our own code.
*Goal*
 Have a standard for how we do the sprint reviews
*Gap*
 Discuss among us how we want to do the sprint reiviews
best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)
*Now*
 Still working with Github, Git and Trello, most setup complete, looking for suitable IDE
*Goal*
 Learn how to use the tools efficiently and according to best practices and find an IDE to work in.
*Gap*

relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say
*Now*
 We are still in the early stages of trying to apply Scrum to our workflow. Much is confusing, it is difficult to adhere to the processes and “rules” laid out by The Scrum Guide as this is new to us.

*Goal*
 Formulate Scrum rules for our Social Contract.
*Gap*
 Read up more on Scrum and how we can apply these processes in our project.
