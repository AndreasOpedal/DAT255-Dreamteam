# Team Reflection week 6, Monday 7/5

**The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now:* Further positive feedback from the product owners based on what we presented last wednesday. We’re therefore continuing working towards the epic we choose with the Gantt-schedule looking like the pilots already existing system. 

*Goal:* To finish our user stories and tasks from last week and create new ones from the epic that we can discuss on wednesday with the product owner(s). By completing more tasks we also want to show a more complete pilot view on wednesday.

*Gap:* Attend the tuition on wednesday, to make sure we’re still on the right track. We’ll also sit down together and create new user stories to further advance towards completing our first epic.

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now:*  The time put in by every member of the team is equal and we feel that we have a well distributed work burden in the team. Our KPI:s point in that way as well with an all time high last week. We’ve seen members more responsible for seeking new tasks, but understood that the social contract is not the problem, but the short coming of the sprint log. 

*Goal:* To continue having a social contract that all group members are satisfied with and follow.

*Gap:* Continuing update the social contract whenever needed.

**success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

“We’ve Interpreted this question as how well we have achieved with having definitions of done in our user stories”

*Now:* We did not succeed in having a “more measurable success criteria that is easier to evaluate”. In fact we did not have any concrete success criterias for our user stories. 

When creating the user stories we had trouble deciding when it was finished. Currently regarding the communication we need to create a definition of done for each user story and task in order to work effectively.

*Goal:* To have a measurable success criteria that is easier to evaluate for each user story.

*Gap:* When creating new user stories we’ll make sure to include “definitions of done” for each user story

**your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

*Now:* We believe that we have not yet reached enough functionality to make it worth time the time for the end user to test it but we had enough functionality to show a demo for the product owner which went successful.

*Goal:* To create enough new functionality to make it worth the time required for the end user to test it

*Gap:* Complete more user stories so that we have something of the required value to display.

**the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

*Now:*  We still only have a basic knowledge about out programming environment. But this far we have decided to not use the package react-native-easy-grid to visualize the timeline. Instead we will use the (already present) Views.

*Goal:* Have a well enough understanding about the structure behind the current application. The goal is to use an API, if needed.

*Gap:* The gap is thereby not directly associated with API’s or architecture patterns. This will come naturally when we move forward in the project. 

**the behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

*Now:* We have started to implement a view that will mirror the system that the pilots already use. This far we’ve added a new view for the pilots that show vertical lines for every hour with another line for the current time. We’ve also been able to add boxes representing ships based on a Date object.

As said earlier we feel that we do not have enough functionality to show the end user, but since we’ve gotten good response from the PO we feel that we’re on the right course.

*Goal:* The goal is to implement a natural behavioural pattern for the pilots that mimics how they currently use their own system (which they like) so that the user experience can be slick.

*Gap:* To gather more information and opinions from the PO and use this to create a more polished version that can be showed to the end user.

**the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

*Now:* We have got a picture of the structural overview of the application from starting to develop the app. Since we are developing an existing app, we have agreed that it is not worth the time to get an even better understanding just by reading code. We have discovered that we get a better understanding of the code when we perform value-adding activities (learning by doing) instead of just reading code.

This sprint we received valuable feedback from Pontus on how the different components interact with each other. This helped us reaching our goal to pinpoint which code belongs to certain function in the programs, thereby reducing the time needed to complete a given tasks. 

*Goal:* Continue with our goal to be able to pinpoint where in the code that a given task should be performed without too much time or effort. 

*Gap:* Keep doing user stories and tasks so that we, as a side effect, can get a better understanding of the app structure. Also, ask Pontus for help to clarify any classes that might cause confusion for the group. 

**your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

*Now:* We have the past sprint started to estimate the tasks. This has worked well since it is then much easier to estimate the whole user story. The “standard pattern” regarding estimation is now to first break down the user story into tasks, estimate each of these tasks and then add together all of the task estimates to get the estimate for the user story. Determining acceptance criteria has not yet been done.

*Goal:* To have a Definition of Done for each user story so that we internally can divide the work among ourselves more efficiently and remove any ambivalence regarding what is complete and not. We also need to create acceptance criteria together with the product owner. 

*Gap:* A Definition of Done in the form of a checklist need to be established for each of the sprint’s user stories. Establish acceptance criteria with the product owner.


**the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

*Now:*The previous week we were satisfied with how the KPIs were working for us. Since we started with estimates on a task level, this week we have had a new discussion regarding Velocity and Overhead.  When looking at Overhead in the context of the scrum process we note that it is not of a direct benefit to us. There is an indirect benefit in that it forces us to keep well maintained log books of our work but as such we cannot say for certain that it is keeping our meetings effective.

We also had a discussion regarding the Velocity KPI, and that we have a problem with the accuracy of our estimates, which in turn is affecting this KPI. But we cannot directly see how we are doing on accuracy - it would require changing the velocity KPI or introducing a new one. 

We have decided to try out a new KPI that measures the accuracy of our estimates, since our current KPI’s do not cover this aspect. This KPI is defined as follows: the actual time that it takes to complete a task is divided by the estimate of this task. This is calculated for every completed task of that sprint, after which a mean value is calculated. The optimal outcome for this KPI is therefore 100%. However, the objective has been set to being within a range of +/-40%. From prior experience with estimation, we discussed that an error by one work day (8 hours) would be reasonable. This corresponds to 40% as the sprints consists of 20 hours of work for each team member (8/20 = 0,4).

Further, we considered removing the Overhead KPI but since we want to evaluate our progress based on the new Accuracy KPI, we feel that both introducing a new KPI and removing an old one in the same Sprint will make the impact from each decision harder to measure. Thus the Overhead KPI will remain for the coming Sprint.

*Goal:* The overall goal is to have three KPI’s that can motivate the team to move forward and reach the respective objectives set for these KPI’s. They should create incentives for good communication, maximize value of time spent, estimate the tasks in an accurate manner, perform the required tasks and complement each other in these regards. Our goal for this sprint is to keep performing well in our current API’s, as well as create good prerequisites for evaluating the new KPI about estimation accuracy for next week’s sprint retrospective. 

*Gap:* For the Velocity KPI: Reach the set objective for the sprint and evaluate how the new KPI complements velocity. 

For the Overhead KPI: How will the introduced KPI affect Overhead - the coming Sprint will determine if we modify it somehow or remove it. Evaluate to see if it is really needed since the meeting time for each week is basically constant. 

For the Communication KPI: We have seen higher and higher total averages, the following week will be a good indicator of whether our long term information sharing is working as intended.

For the Estimation Accuracy KPI: Try out and see. Every team member needs to fill in how much time a task has taken after it is completed and document this on the Scrum Board in Trello. 



**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now:* Since some of our team member had some time left after they had finished their user story (and since our sprint backlog was empty) they started looking for different testing method of the code. At that moment, they came to the conclusion that it might not be necessary for us to implement a testing routine using an external program like snapshot tests with JEST since we do not have that time to do that properly (learn, implement and understand the tests). By doing that, it gives us more time for coding, that we prioritize more since we believe it’s more value adding for this project and for the PO:s. Instead, we will do some “stupid” testing on our own, for example the extremes, like in the border cases in the timeline. We’ll also review each others code and therefore we make sure everything works on someone else's development environment. 

*Goal:* Create our own tests for cases that probably will go wrong (we’re allocating our resources for the most important parts). 

*Gap:* We have to learn how to do the testing we think is necessary with the code we have.  

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now:* We have assigned the following role: Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible, responsible for Trello, reminding-of-individual-reflection and uploading team reflection responsible, responsible for contact with course examiner and Git-responsible. 

The roles we have assigned are working good. Each person have a responsible role either as official in the group or by doing hard work coding.

As we have started coding we have evaluated if we need an additional person responsible for the testing procedures. We have concluded that our current procedures are working fine and that a specific role as testing responsible is not needed.  

*Goal:* Equal share of work to each person in the project.

*Gap:* Continue the evaluation on the distribution of work, making sure the right person have the right role and that everyone is pleased with the current situation. We will do this by keeping an open discussion climate and continuously communicating how the work is distributed amongst the group members. Transparency is key.

**the agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now:* 
The breakdown of assignment and using pair programming as a work method has shown to be very successful. The communication and teamwork in both the smaller teams and the group received good reviews in the KPI. One small problem was defining when a task was done. This process was reviewed during the meeting and the group decided to be better at this part of the group communication.

During the Sprint review the team also discussed the upcoming week’s and how we would like to work in the finishing sprints of the project. We decided what will be included in the final report and delegated the work load amongst the team members, optimizing the process by placing the right resources at the right places.

*Goal:* As our members have learned more about different coding aspects we have earned different skill sets. Our goal will be to better communicate when a pair programming team is stuck in a user story and easier recieve help from other teams. Another goal is to keep analyzing the optimization of the process, making sure the right person is performing the right tasks.

*Gap:*  We will reach our goal by faster and more clear communication in our group chat. By having more detailed task it will become easier for other teams to learn how to overcome problems and actually finishing a task. 


**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now:* Last sprint we spent on average 13.1 hours. Since it is the last week’s before the bachelor thesis deadline most group members have spent their time on this. The last sprint also consisted of fewer days due to a holiday. As we are approaching the end of this project we are realizing that having a 20 hours average for the whole period while be hard to meet. However, we will try to keep up a 20 hours work weeks in the upcoming sprints. 

*Goal:* Get on track towards a 20 hours average for the end of the course, realising it will probably become 20 hours work weeks instead of an average time for all weeks.

*Gap:* In order to achieve our goal we will continue our work to become better at delegating assignments via our sprint planning/trello. This week we are under tremendous stress from the bachelor thesis deadline and are recognizing that it will be difficult to reach 20 hours per person. As our members belong to different bachelor thesis with different levels of progress we will put extra effort in our sprint planning so we assign a reasonable amount of workload for each person. 


**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now:* 

We met our product owners in this sprint and they were satisfied with our accomplishments so far and believe we are on the right track. 

*Goal:* To be able to demo a visual representation of the achieved tasks (Complete Gantt-chart and Port Call fetch) during next sprint’s product owner meeting. Also send and receive positive feedback on demo’s sent to the Pilot central.

*Gap:* To reach our goal we must both finish the technical aspects but also work more on the visual presentation in order to satisfy the product owners further. 


**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now:* We have established a functional Trello setup with tasks/stories/epics in which our group has become more comfortable in using to manage our workflow. We still have some more work to do to get all our members to keep filling info into our Scrum boards. We have been working more with Git, pull requesting and merging different branches into each other has worked with successful results.

*Goal:* Make sure everyone in the group are using Trello in the way that was decided during this week’s sprint review, with new estimations of the time needed for completing a task. Another goal is to achieve successful pull requests and make sure everyone is comfortable performing them.

*Gap:* We will incentive the group to use Trello by establishing an KPI which requires that information is provided into Trello (KPI: Estimation accuracy). The group members who have performed pull request will share their knowledge on how it works and aiding if any problems arises. 

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

*Now:* 
We decided to keep the same reflection as last week since we still have not had any lectures there is no new information to collect from guest lectures. In order to tackle assignments without knowledge, we’ve been thinking about what Mikael from Trine said about jumping on to something new the agile way. We’re also iterating back to the lecture slides to get information about related topics (for instance INVEST, carpaccio etc.)  

*Goal:* 
Feel confident and comfortable about tackle assignment without knowledge. 

*Gap:* Just continue doing it! Help each other during the group meetings to mention that we don’t need a complete understanding of something in order to start to do it. Also provide useful tips to each other on how to find the right info in vast uncertainty. 


# Team Reflection week 5, Monday 30/4
**The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now:* We had a meeting with the product owners on Wednesday where they approved our ideas for user stories. From this input we got a prioritized list of user stories that we had already broken down during Monday’s meeting. The scope of the project is also more clear now than it was the last sprint. The scope includes our three epics, whereby we expect to be able to finish the first one. 

*Goal:* Right now the goal is to finish the tasks that have been set up so that we can create value for the product owners and end users. We want to be able to present further progress to the product owner on Wednesday.

*Gap:* Break down the user stories into more even smaller tasks so that the work can flow more efficiently. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now:*  We feel that the breakdown of user stories into tasks will not always reflect the work burden and actual time that is needed to complete the tasks. This means that some members will be done with their work much sooner than others. In order to ensure that our gap to have a shared work burden is met, we need to enforce this through the social contract. We will therefore update the contract so that each member is responsible for assigning him or herself with new tasks once their own tasks have been completed.
If we feel this rule is not being adhered to we can ensure compliance by doing checks on log books and commits to GitHub.

Updates to social contract:
All members are responsible for making sure that they have work assigned to them during the sprint. Once the work you have assigned yourself is complete you shall assign yourself new tasks from Trello.

*Goal:* To have a social contract that all group members are satisfied with and follow. 

*Gap:*  Test how well the current iteration of the social contract where members are responsible for actively seeking new tasks, is at creating an evenly distributed workload among the team members.

**success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

*Now:* The product owners are satisfied with our user stories and the success criteria is therefore to complete these. 

*Goal:* To have an even more measurable success criteria that is easier to evaluate. 

*Gap:* As the project moves forward we will get a better idea of where we are heading. We will thus be able to have a deeper discussion with the PO to come up with more measurable success criteria.

**your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

*Now:* We have completed one user story (for the end user) but not yet performed a acceptance test on it since the workload (both for us and the end user) to carry through such a test is to big in comparison to the value created this far.

*Goal:* To create enough new functionality to make it worth the time required for the end user to test it 

*Gap:* Complete more user stories so that we have something of the required value to display. 

**the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

*Now:*  We still have a basic knowledge about Javascript and React Native. We have also started looking at what API’s that might be useful for completing our user stories, for instance an API for developing the “GANTT chart”.

*Goal:* Have a well enough understanding about the structure behind the current application. The goal is to use an API, if needed.

*Gap:* The gap is thereby not directly associated with API’s or architecture patterns. This will come naturally when we move forward in the project. 

**the behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

*Now:* Looking at the previous weeks goal, we have realized that creating a notification function is an epic, which will take more time than is available in a sprint to complete. We now know that regular push notifications is not supported by React Native. Regarding interaction within the app, we have made progress towards a planning view.

The hypothesis on the behavior within the app remains from the previous week. The end users have confirmed that it is the pilot organizations planning function that will be using the app, thus being able to plan the work for the pilot function in Port Gothenburg is what the app needs to achieve.

Since we cannot affect the existing system we have made a strategic decision to build a visual representation of their existing system on top of the portCDM backend. The option would have been to instead implement portCDM backend into their existing Fenix-system. 

We have also noted that our end user does not use a phone for their work. They work using a web-interface, and an iPad tablet. Since the main code is javascript which is easily portable to a web interface, and we have the option to emulate in a tablet view, we will continue on the path we have started on rather than switching to developing straight to web. 

*Goal:* The goal is to implement a natural behavioural pattern for the pilots that mimics how they currently use their own system (which they like) so that the user experience can be slick.

*Gap:* To gather feedback and information from the end users. A concrete example is that we have asked for a screenshot of the pilots’ planning system in order to mimic this in our app. We will also use acceptance tests in the future.

**the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

*Now:* We have got a picture of the structural overview of the application from starting to develop the app. Since we are developing an existing app, we have agreed that it is not worth the time to get an even better understanding just by reading code. We have discovered that we get a better understanding of the code when we perform value-adding activities (learning by doing) instead of just reading code.

*Goal:* Our goal is to be able to pinpoint where in the code that a given task should be performed without too much time or effort. 

*Gap:* Keep doing user stories and tasks so that we, as a side effect, can get a better understanding of the app structure. 

**your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

*Now:* We have presented our user stories and confirmed them with the PO’s, but the work of establishing acceptance criteria for these user stories and confirming these with the PO’s remains. 

*Goal:* Communicate and confirm acceptance criteria together with PO’s. Breaking down user stories into smaller tasks.

*Gap:* Further division of our user stories into estimable tasks and proposed acceptance criteria as a basis for discussion with our PO’s.


**the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

*Now:* We have established three KPI’s and have used them for three sprints, we have also discussed if they are still relevant for tracking our process and concluded that they are good enough. After some review we still believe that our time-tracking (Overhead) KPI is a good measurement because it’s a good way to start discussions about how we spent our time this sprint. Furthermore we believe that this KPI has a purpose for eliminating waste time. 

The communication KPI reached all time high this week, probably due to our fragmentation of communication channels to three different messenger chats depending on topic. 
 
The velocity KPI reached an all time low. We believe the reason for this is the increase of uncertainty of estimating activities involving code writing. It’s been harder than we thought to understand react native and the existing code. 

*Goal:* Have three KPI’s that contribute to facilitating good communication, maximizing time spent on value-contributing activities and accurate assessment of our own velocity. Our goal this sprint will be to get closer to our targeted velocity. 

*Gap:* For the Velocity KPI: To get a better estimation we will start to estimate individual tasks to get a more granular division of projected time spent. Generally: continue to evaluate the KPI’s during the sprint retrospectives.

**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now:* We have noticed that Findbugs is does not work for reviewing javascript code. Since this has been the first week of coding, we have starting to understand the need of a testing system. 

*Goal:* To structure up our testing procedures so everyone feel comfortable testing another persons code.

*Gap:* We’ve talked about using GitHub’s pull request as a first step when sharing the code for review we will look at the option of implementing a third party testing tool. We will organize our pair of programmers so they know which other groups code they will test. 

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now:* We have assigned the following role: Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible, responsible for Trello, reminding-of-individual-reflection and uploading team reflection responsible, responsible for contact with course examiner and Git-responsible.

*Goal:* Equal share of work to each person in the project.

*Gap:* As we start coding we will investigate if we need any additional role related the coding. For example one possible role might be to have overall responsiblity for the tesing procedures.

**the agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now:* 

Last sprint we broke down assignments into groups of two which helped us to advanced our deliveries on multiple fronts. Due to the vast uncertainty some of our assignments met the deadline but unfortunately not all of them. 

*Goal:* Get a better overview of everyone’s current workload and their eventual obstacles to reaching the goals.  

*Gap:* We will reach this goal by being better of using our daily scrums . We will also create a more fair and better description of our tasks so we can easier see how far each group have progressed on their user story.

**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now:* Last sprint we spent on average 15.4 hours. Other interests in our life this week have been interfering with this project, such as the bachelor thesis. 
. 
*Goal:* Get on track towards a 20 hrs average for the end of the course.

*Gap:* We need to input more hours in the coming weeks to reach the 20 hour average. In order to raise this, we have to be better delegating assignments. By improving our trello scrum board (see Q below), this problem should be solved for the next week. 


**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now:* We have established a standard procedure for conducting the sprint reviews. The product owners were satisfied with our product backlog and what our long term goal of the app was (creating a new view in the app based on the pilots already existing system).

*Goal:* That the product owner is satisfied with the user stories we have produced. That the product owner can help us prioritize our different user stories for the sprint. 

*Gap:* Prioritize user stories, create acceptance criterias and present them to the product owners. In the case that we can’t present working code on a specific user story an alternative approach is to show a sketch on how it might visually look to make it easier for the product owner to give us relevant feedback. 



**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now:* We have finally made sure that everyone’s Android Studio is working. Since this has been the first week of coding, we’ve gained some knowledges about the best way of using trello. 
This week we structured our scrum board on trello with user stories as card filled with a check list consisting of tasks. It didn’t go as well we’ve planned as we weren’t sure how we would do it the best way. After some trial and error we feel more comfortable now. 

*Goal:* Using technologies such as GitHub to better manage version control. Having a Trello that works efficiently to manage our tasks and that we are comfortable in using it. 

*Gap:* We will use GitHubs tool such as pull request to easier decide if a specific branch should be merged into our master branch. We will decide in our group about how to use specific Trello settings (such as checklist) for our group’s best practice the time given. 



**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

*Now:* Since we have not had any lectures there is no new information to collect from guest lectures. In order to tackle assignments without knowledge, we’ve been thinking about what 
Mikael from Trine said about jumping on to something new the agile way. We’re also iterating back to the lecture slides to get information about related topics (for instance INVEST, carpaccio etc.)  

*Goal:* 
Feel confident and comfortable (read: not stressed) about tackle assignment without knowledge. 

*Gap:* Just continue doing it! Help each other during the group meetings to mention that we don’t need a complete understanding of something in order to start to do it. Also provide useful tips to each other on how to find the right info in vast uncertainty. 



# Team Reflection week 4, Monday 23/4
**the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now:* We’ve started creating User Stories, now we have User stories that are more or less useful, but they have not been evaluated with the INVEST criteria yet and are therefore not broken down into tasks. We did present the user stories to the end user representatives, but we did not manage to present them to the product owner as there was no time on the supervision meeting. 

*Goa:l* To present our user stories to the product owners on wednesday. Also to create a prioritized list containing user stories and start breaking down and work on each user story.

*Gap:* Making sure we get a meeting with the Product owners, since we didn’t manage to last week. We also need to make sure that we all sit down together to take care of the user story situaton and evaluating it with the INVEST criteria.  

**your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now:*  Have updated the social contract so that one person is responsible for uploading the group reflection.

*Goal:* To have a social contract that all group members are satsified with and follow. 

*Gap:*  Test how well the current iteration of the social contract is at creating an evenly distributed workload among the team members.

**success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

*Now:* Since we weren’t able to meet with the Product owner due to lack of time (and too much people) we have yet to present our current situation and User Stories to the Product Owners. 

*Goal:* Determine the success criteria in consultation with the product owner.

*Gap:* Meet with the product owner and present a draft of prioritizations which we as a group have identified.

**your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

*Now:* We have not yet generated any code on which to conduct acceptance tests.

*Goal:* Create our first acceptance tests once code is in place. 

*Gap:* Generate code that we can test.

**the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

*Now:*  We have now acquired a basic knowledge about Javascript and React Native. 

*Goal:* Have a enough understanding about the structure behind the current application.

*Gap:* Implement our knowledge about React Native into code (we are like Jon Snow, we know nothing, sorry).

**the behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

*Now:* We have a basic understanding of how the PortableCDM app works and how users interact with it. We understand the needs of the user and have created a hypothesis on behavior and evaluated our own experience in order to make changes in the design of the app.

*Goal:* Understand how to create and implement a notification function into the application

*Gap:* Two or three people are responsible for searching information about creating notifications in React Native, and should be able to inform the rest of the group about this during next week’s meeting. 

**the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

*Now:* We do not yet have an understanding of the general (main) application presented.

*Goal:* The goal is to acquire a good enough understanding of the structure so that we can 
present a roadmap of how the different classes interact with each other. 

*Gap:* Delegate the task of acquiring this understanding to one or two project members which they will present to the rest of the group during the week. 

**your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

*Now:* We have started the process of creating user stories but have not yet prioritized them We have had two meetings with the pilot and gotten a better understanding of the main application. We haven’t presented our user stories to the product owner. 

*Goal:* Have a preliminary and prioritized set of user stories, some of which are broken down into tasks. Come up with an acceptance criteria together with the product owners.

*Gap:* A smaller group of people are responsible for prioritizing the set of user stories and create acceptance criterias which are to be presented to the product owners on wednesday.


**the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

*Now:* We have established three KPI’s and have used them for three sprints, we have also discussed if they are still relevant for tracking our process and concluded that they are good enough. There are other alternatives to the time-tracking (Overhead) KPI, but the group have decided that we will stick with the original one during at least one sprint containing coding in order to assess it fairly. For the velocity KPI, we fell short this sprint as well... 

*Goal:* Have three KPI’s that contribute to facilitating good communication, maximizing time spent on value-contributing activities and accurate assessment of our own velocity. Further assess the Overhead KPI during the following sprint. 

*Gap:* For the Velocity KPI: Important to divide user stories into smaller tasks that are easier to estimate. Generally: continue to evaluate the KPI’s during the sprint retrospectives. Keep tracking the Overhead KPI during next week’s review meeting.

**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now:* We do not have code to test yet.

*Goal:* To learn more on working with one person testing another persons code.

*Gap:* Be at a stage where we write code and then test the generated code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now:* We have assigned the following role: Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible, responsible for Trello, reminding-of-indiviudal-reflection and uploading team reflection responsible, responsible for contact with course examiner and Git-responsible.

*Goal:* Equal share of work to each person in the project.

*Gap:* Early stage of the project with limited amount of work to assign. Better role descriptions need to be formulated for future efforts.

**the agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now:* We are in the state that we are comfortable enough to use and set up User Stories in Trello. We have also created another group chat in able to separate “informative” information and formal information regarding the application/development. We have also implemented daily scrums for every time all of us in the project group meet (2-3 days a week)


*Goal:* Break down the group into more individual task in order to become more effective.

*Gap:* Assign specific tasks to smaller groups and set deadlines for when that group should be done with their task and inform the rest of the group.

**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now:* Last sprint we spent on average 15 hours. This was because of a lack of having value-adding assignments. 

*Goal:* Get on track towards a 20 hrs average for the end of the course.

*Gap:* We need to input more hours in the coming weeks to reach the 20 hour average. This is a conscious strategy though, as we want to be able to spend more time when there is more programming to do. 

**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now:* We have established a standard procedure for conducting the sprint reviews. 

*Goal:* That the product owner is satisfied with the user stories we have produced. 

*Gap:* Prioritize user stories, create acceptance criterias and present them to the product owners

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now:* We have found a suitable IDE to work with: Sublime. We have developed a best practice for using Git and GitHub that all group members will follow when coding. Android Studio has been set up for all but one of the group members. We have started looking at Javascript and React Native. All but one group members have set up the development environment. 

*Goal:* As one of the user stories is to implement a notification function, the goal is now to understand the technologies (classes etc) associated with implementing this. 

*Gap:* Solve the setup issues with Android Studio for the last PC user in our group by providing the person with the information the others have learned when setting up the developer environment. We want to search the web for more information regarding notification functions in javascript, this will be done in smaller groups.




**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

*Now:* Since we haven’t had any lectures there is no new information to collect from guest lectures. We have had a meeting with the examiners in the course where we discussed the process, which was helpful in creating this reflection.We still find it very hard to adapt the agile way of working, because we find ourselves wanting to plan for everything ahead. 


*Goal:* To mentally adapt the agile way of working, i.e. learning how to tackle assignments without having complete knowledge in advance. 

*Gap:* Just continue doing it! Help each other during the group meetings to mention that we don’t need a complete understanding of something in order to start to do it. 

# Team Reflection week 3, Monday 16/4
**the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now* We have had our first meeting with the pilot station

*Goal* To have a list of user stories in prioritized order that can easily be broken down into tasks

*Gap* Process information from first meeting with pilot, develop user stories and ideas and prioritize features in the application before the second meeting with the pilot. Present user stories to end user representative as well as product owner. 

**your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now*  Have updated the social contract with how the daily scrums work and how the time log is structured. 

*Goal* To have a social contract that all group members are satsified with and follow. 

*Gap*  Test how well the current iteration of the social contract is at creating an evenly distributed workload among the team members.

**success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

*Now* We have met our pilot and have an overall overview of what will be important in the application. We have not yet met with the product owner to determine success criterias. 

*Goal* Determine the success criteria from the Product Owner

*Gap* Meet with the product owner and present a draft of prioritizations wich we as a group has identified.

**your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

*Now* We have not yet generated any code on which to conduct acceptance tests.

*Goal* Create our first acceptance tests once code is in place. 

*Gap* Generate code that we can test.

**the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

*Now*  We have started looking into the design of the given PortCDM application and gained a basic understanding of how it works

*Goal* Have a good enough understanding so that we start developing the application

*Gap* Learn about React Native

**the behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

*Now* We have a basic understanding of how the PortableCDM app works and how users interact with it. 

*Goal* Make incremental adjustments to the app as it is used today.

*Gap* Understand the needs of the user in order to create a hypothesis on behavior and evaluate our own experience to make changes in the design of the app. 

**the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

*Now* We do not yet have an understanding of the general (main) application presented.

*Goal* We choose to not gain a deep understanding of the structural overview of the whole app. The goal is therefore to get a good enough understanding of the classes we are interacting with to make the changes we want to do. 

*Gap* Find those specific classes that we need to use in order to create value for our product owners. 

**your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

*Now* We only have a foundation towards user stories, and not yet any “real” user stories that we can start breaking down into tasks.

*Goal* Have a preliminary and prioritized set of user stories.

*Gap* Create user stories, prioritize them, meet with Pilot, present user stories to product owner,  get familiar with main application.


**the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

*Träffsäkerhet i Velocity - hur väl uppskattar vi vår velocity?*

Hur: Genom att uppskatta tid (mantimmar) som gruppen kan avsätta, och använda detta som initial velocity.
Nuläge: Vi har inte kunnat arbeta ännu i projekt och kan därför inte uppskatta vår träffsäkerhet. 
Mål: Vårt mål är att ligga inom 30% av vår uppskattade Velocity.
Strategi: Efter varje sprint anpassar vi detta mått och stämmer av hur väl detta sätt att mäta velocity stämmer överens med vår faktiska Velocity.

Värde: -
We do not yet have any user stories that we can work with and use to assess our current velocity.


*Kommunikation - hur väl fungerar vår kommunikation i gruppen?*

Hur: Transparens: Hur ärliga har vi varit mot varandra gällande vårt behov av hjälp, tillgänglig tid.
Tydlighet: Hur väl har vi lyckats förmedla information till gruppen, hur “rak” har kommunikationen varit.
Frekvens: Har vi kommunicerat tillräckligt frekvent och i tid?
KPI:n sätts genom att medlemmarna betygsätter kommunikationen i gruppen med ett sammanvägt betyg på en skala 1-5 med en kort motivation till betyget.
Nuläge: Vi har inledningsvis haft brister i skriftlig kommunikation, vad som gåtts igenom, framförallt under möten. Detta påverkade inte de som deltog på plats på mötet men blev tydligt för de som fick delta över Skype.
Mål: Vårt mål är att hålla en hög genomsnittlig nivå på kommunikationen över veckorna med ett snitt över 4.5 av 5.
Strategi: Genom att stämma av i slutet av varje sprint och betygsätta kommunikationen enligt ovan.


Kommentarer: Vi behöver bli bättre på team reflections.


*Overhead - hur stor andel av vår tid är värdeadderande för produktägaren?*

Hur: KPI:n mäts som tid vi lägger ned per vecka minus mötestid och tid lagd på reflektioner genom total tid som lagts ned i projektet.
Nuläge: I nuläget har ingen kod presterats och ingen produktägare presenterats.
Mål: Vårt mål med nuvarande definition är att hålla oss 30% - 50%
Strategi: Genom att stämma av efter varje sprint justerar vi för att se vad som varit icke värdeadderande tid och vad som varit värdeadderande för att iterativt närma oss vad som faktiskt är värdeadderande och på så sätt kunna arbeta för att minska det som inte tillför värde till projektet.


*Now* We have established three KPI’s and have used them for two sprints.

*Goal* Have three KPI’s that contribute to facilitating good communication, maximizing time spent on value-contributing activities and accurate assessment of our own velocity.

*Gap* For the Velocity KPI:Divide user stories into smaller tasks that are easier to estimate. Generally: continue to evaluate the KPI’s during the sprint retrospectives. 

**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now* We do not have code to test yet.

*Goal* To learn more on working with one person testing another persons code.

*Gap* Be at a stage where we write code and then test the generated code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now* We have assigned the following role: Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible, responsible for Trello, reminding-of-indiviudal-reflection responsible, responsible for contact with course examiner and Git-responsible.

*Goal* Equal share of work to each person in the project.

*Gap* Early stage of the project with limited amount of work to assign. Better role descriptions need to be formulated for future efforts.

**the agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now* We have all the theory needed to implement agile practices (through Scrum) for the project. We discussed moving the sprints from monday-monday to wednesday-wednesday since this was some feedback we got from our meeting with Jean-Philippe. We have decided to keep the monday-monday since we want to have the sprint planning the same day as the sprint retrospective and team reflection. If we were to move it to wednesday-wednesday we wouldn't have time to adjust our next sprint planning the same day after meeting the product owners, since we only have group meetings on mondays and wednesdays.

*Goal* In general we want to apply Scrum in an efficient way that works well for our project group. A goal right now however is to consistently use Trello (as a Scrumboard) throughout the sprint. 

*Gap* For Trello: Set up user stories and tasks for the sprint in Trello and then move all the tasks that are completed to the next “step”.

**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now* Most of the group members have spent more than 20 hours the last sprint, as we had problems with setting up the development environment. 

*Goal* Get on track toward a 20 hrs average for the end of the course.

*Gap* We need to input more hours in the coming weeks to reach the 20hour average. This is a conscious strategy though, as we want to be able to spend more time when there is more programming to do. 

**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now* We have established a standard procedure for conducting the sprint reviews. 

*Goal* That the product owner is satisfied with the user stories we have produced. 

*Gap* Make user stories, prioritize them and present them to the product owners

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now* We have found a suitable IDE to work with: Sublime. We have developed a best practice for using Git and GitHub that all group members will follow when coding. Android Studio is still in setup stage for half of the group. There are no best practices yet for Javascript and React Native. 

*Goal* To get a clearer view of how Android Studio works and how we as a group should use it when developing. We should also have a greater understanding of Javascript and the React Native framework.

*Gap* Solve the setup issues with Android Studio for the PC users in the group. Also gain a knowledge base for Javascript, both through theory and learning by doing in the development project. 

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

*Now* We have implemented daily Scrum in our practices. In relation to guest lectures, Mikael spoke a lot about how agile practices advocates doing incremental changes and consistenly moving forward in the project. From most courses at Chalmers we have learned that the opposite oftentimes works best - preparing and studying before implementing that is. We are confused by this paradox. 

*Goal* To mentally adapt the agile way of working, i.e. learning how to tackle assignments without having complete knowledge in advance. 

*Gap* Just do it!™ 


# Team Reflection week 2, Thursday 29/3
**the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now* We have had our first lecture and meeting with product owners.

*Goal* Adjust the application towards the pilot

*Gap* Meet with Pilot to determine success criteria. Divide and conquer user story into manageable tasks
 

**your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

**the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

*Now*  We have had our first lecture on the application.

*Goal* Gain a better understanding of how the application works and is built

*Now* We have established three KPI’s.

*Goal* Have three KPI’s that contribute to facilitating good communication, maximizing time spent on value-contributing activities and accurate assessment of our own velocity. 

*Gap* We are not yet at a stage where all three KPI’s can be fully tested. We will evaluate these KPI’s after each sprint during our retrospective.

**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now* We do not have code to test yet.

*Goal* Läsa in sig på Findbugs och liknande program

*Gap* Gain knowledge of code testing.

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now* We have assigned roles, among others, Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible.

*Gap* Read up on agile practices in software development as well as attend lectures in the course to further our knowledge on agile work practices.

**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now* This week consisted of a shorter sprint. Currently all members short of the 20 hrs goal. Major goals for the sprint achieved regarding knowledge gains.

*Goal* Get on track toward a 20 hrs average for the end of the course.

*Gap* At the moment all project members are short of this goal.

**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now* We have met with the product owners and asked initial general questions regarding scope and expectations. Much is yet to be known on what is needed in the final product. We feel a need to gain a deeper understanding of the application before we can start generating our own code.

*Gap* Find suitable IDE, develop skills working with Git and Trello.

**relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say**

*Now* We are still in the early stages of trying to apply Scrum to our workflow. Much is confusing, it is difficult to adhere to the processes and “rules” laid out by The Scrum Guide as this is new to us. Scrum rules formulated and to be reviewed for our next meeting.


*Goal* Continue to develop and learn the processes of agile development.

*Gap* Read up more on Scrum and how we can apply these processes in our project. 


# Team Reflection week 1, Thursday 22/3

**The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now*
Due to limited information about the project and its scope, it is impossible to tell at this stage.

*Goal*
The goal is to gain enough knowledge about the project and expectations of the project owner to be able to define the chosen scope of the application.

*Gap*
Through lectures, literature and conversations with the product owner we will get further insight into the project and what features should be prioritized in the application. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now*
During the first week a first draft of a social contract was created containing specifications such as; members and email addresses, meeting schedule, rules on attendance, responsibilities and roles, time log policy, documentation policy and ambition levels.

*Goal*
Since we are currently lacking information regarding the project, we were unable to complete the social contract. Next week we will therefore add new roles and responsibilities and more detailed description of scrum rules and sprint techniques. 

*Gap*
To be able to fill this weeks information gap we need to attend lectures on scrum techniques and discuss our take on it. We will also review the course literature to see if we can find more information on working with scrum. By attending the project introduction lecture (next week) we will hopefully get a fuller picture of the project scope and will then be able to adjust the social contract correctly.

The following points we are not yet able to define since the information hasn’t been reviewed this early in the course. Our goal is to fill in the gaps by attending lectures and gaining knowledge from course literature and information from the project owner:

* **The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

* **Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

* **The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

* **The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

* **The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

* **Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

* **The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

* **Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

**The roles you have used within the team
***Now*
In our first week we have assigned some roles to our team members including Scrum master, secretary for meetings, a casting vote, a chief location officer (CLO). 

*Goal*
To have a relevant task assigned for every member, but still an equal amount of work.

*Gap*
To reach our goal we will have to learn about which relevant tasks that exists in a project of this format and have responsibilities that require somewhat equal efforts for a fair workload. **
**

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now*
In the first week our team had initially limited experiences of agile practices, both about what it is and how it should be adopted in an IT project. 

*Goal*
To get acquainted with and use Scrum during the project. 

*Gap*
We will learn the agile practices by going to the lectures as well as reading literatures about useful practices that we can try and evaluate. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now*
We have created a table where we keep records of the time spent on this course.   

*Gap*
Hard to reach 20h/week in the first week since we haven’t been introduced to the application. This week we have spent the time on lectures and learning git/scrum practices, around 12 hours in total as a group as of thursday, first week. 

*Goal*
Reach 20h/week for every member which will be audited every week.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

In this section we’re considering this weeks LEGO exercise

*Now*
We tried to asses out team velocity and the scope of the user stories.

*Goal*
Our goal is to become better at assessing velocity and scope of the user stories.

*Gap*
Live activity based training (aka learning by doing).

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now*
We have started using GitHub, Git as well as Trello.

*Goal*
Learn how to use the tools efficiently and according to best practices.

*Gap*
Initially learning by doing. Further down the road we will consult online guides and other available resources.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We have not yet had any guest lectures or read any course literature.
