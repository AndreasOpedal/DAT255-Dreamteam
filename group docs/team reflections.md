# Team Reflection week 2, Thursday 29/3
**the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now* We have had our first lecture and meeting with product owners. 

*Goal* Understand pilots to determine which features should be included and their priorities.

*Gap* Meet with pilot

**your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now* Added responsibility roles: Git responsible, Trello responsible.

*Goal* Shared work burden among team members and adhere to the social contract

*Gap* Test how well the current iteration of the social contract is at creating an evenly distributed workload among the team members.
the

**success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

*Now* We don’t know what the pilot and or product owner determines critical for success.

*Goal* Adjust the application towards the pilot

*Gap* Meet with Pilot to determine success criteria. Divide and conquer user story into manageable tasks
 

**your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

*Now* We have not yet generated any code on which to conduct acceptance tests.

*Goal* Create our first acceptance tests once code is in place.

*Gap* Meet with Pilot to determine what is important. Generate code that we can test.

**the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

*Now*  We have had our first lecture on the application.

*Goal* Gain a better understanding of how the application works and is built

*Gap* Read the given APIs and others that might be used in the project

**the behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

*Now* We do not yet have an application/known behavior that we can get a behavorial overview of.

*Goal* Get to know how our application can best be used

*Gap* Understand the needs of the user in order to create a hypothesis on behavior.

**the structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**


*Now* We do not yet have an understanding of the general (main) application presented.

*Goal* Gain an understanding of the main application in order to determine the fit our specialized application.

*Gap* Read up on API’s, become familiar with main application.

**your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

*Now* Do not know end user needs and demand from product owner.

*Goal* Understand user needs and intended usage in order to formulate UX criteria.

*Gap* Meet with Pilot, get familiar with main application.

**the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**


*Träffsäkerhet i Velocity - hur väl uppskattar vi vår velocity?*

Hur: Genom att uppskatta tid (mantimmar) som gruppen kan avsätta, och använda detta som initial velocity.
Nuläge: Vi har inte kunnat arbeta ännu i projekt och kan därför inte uppskatta vår träffsäkerhet. 
Mål: Vårt mål är att ligga inom 30% av vår uppskattade Velocity.
Strategi: Efter varje sprint anpassar vi detta mått och stämmer av hur väl detta sätt att mäta velocity stämmer överens med vår faktiska Velocity.

Värde: -
We do not yet have any user stories that we can work with and use to assess our current velocity.

*Kommunikation - hur väl fungerar vår kommunikation i gruppen?*

Hur: Transparens: Hur ärliga har vi varit mot varandra gällande vårt behov av hjälp, tillgänglig tid.
Tydlighet: Hur väl har vi lyckats förmedla information till gruppen, hur “rak” har kommunikationen varit.
Frekvens: Har vi kommunicerat tillräckligt frekvent och i tid?
KPI:n sätts genom att medlemmarna betygsätter kommunikationen i gruppen med ett sammanvägt betyg på en skala 1-5 med en kort motivation till betyget.
Nuläge: Vi har inledningsvis haft brister i skriftlig kommunikation, vad som gåtts igenom, framförallt under möten. Detta påverkade inte de som deltog på plats på mötet men blev tydligt för de som fick delta över Skype.
Mål: Vårt mål är att hålla en hög genomsnittlig nivå på kommunikationen över veckorna med ett snitt över 4 av 5.
Strategi: Genom att stämma av i slutet av varje sprint och betygsätta kommunikationen enligt ovan.


Kommentarer: Vi behöver bli bättre på team reflections.
Värde: 4,625


*Overhead - hur stor andel av vår tid är värdeadderande för produktägaren?*

Hur: KPI:n mäts som tid vi lägger ned per vecka minus mötestid och tid lagd på reflektioner genom total tid som lagts ned i projektet.
Nuläge: I nuläget har ingen kod presterats och ingen produktägare presenterats.
Mål: Vårt mål med nuvarande definition är att hålla oss under 50%
Strategi: Genom att stämma av efter varje sprint justerar vi för att se vad som varit icke värdeadderande tid och vad som varit värdeadderande för att iterativt närma oss vad som faktiskt är värdeadderande och på så sätt kunna arbeta för att minska det som inte tillför värde till projektet.



*Now* We have established three KPI’s.

*Goal* Have three KPI’s that contribute to facilitating good communication, maximizing time spent on value-contributing activities and accurate assessment of our own velocity. 

*Gap* We are not yet at a stage where all three KPI’s can be fully tested. We will evaluate these KPI’s after each sprint during our retrospective.

**code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

*Now* We do not have code to test yet.

*Goal* Läsa in sig på Findbugs och liknande program

*Gap* Gain knowledge of code testing.

**The roles you have used within the team**

*Now* We have assigned roles, among others, Scrummaster, a responsible of booking group rooms, a secretary and meeting protocol responsible.

*Goal* Equally share of work to each person in the project.

*Gap* Early stage of the project with limited amount of work to assign. Better role descriptions need to be formulated for future efforts.

**the agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now*  We have completed our first sprint. In our second sprint we have broken down the scenario provided into a timeline for a vessel on approach to the port of Gothenburg

*Goal* Gain a better understanding of agile practices and apply them.

*Gap* Read up on agile practices in software development as well as attend lectures in the course to further our knowledge on agile work practices.

**the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now* This week consisted of a shorter sprint. Currently all members short of the 20 hrs goal. Major goals for the sprint achieved regarding knowledge gains.

*Goal* Get on track toward a 20 hrs average for the end of the course.

*Gap* At the moment all project members are short of this goal.

**the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

*Now* We have met with the product owners and asked initial general questions regarding scope and expectations. Much is yet to be known on what is needed in the final product. We feel a need to gain a deeper understanding of the application before we can start generating our own code.

*Goal* Have a standard for how we do the sprint reviews

*Gap* Discuss among us how we want to do the sprint reviews at next meeting.

**best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now* Still working with Github, Git and Trello, most setup complete, looking for suitable IDE

*Goal* Learn how to use the tools efficiently and according to best practices and find an IDE to work in.

*Gap* Find suitable IDE, develop skills working with Git and Trello.

**relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say**

*Now* We are still in the early stages of trying to apply Scrum to our workflow. Much is confusing, it is difficult to adhere to the processes and “rules” laid out by The Scrum Guide as this is new to us. Scrum rules formulated and to be reviewed for our next meeting.


*Goal* Continue to develop and learn the processes of agile development.

*Gap* Read up more on Scrum and how we can apply these processes in our project. 


# Team Reflection week 1, Thursday 22/3

**The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

*Now*
Due to limited information about the project and its scope, it is impossible to tell at this stage.

*Goal*
The goal is to gain enough knowledge about the project and expectations of the project owner to be able to define the chosen scope of the application.

*Gap*
Through lectures, literature and conversations with the product owner we will get further insight into the project and what features should be prioritized in the application. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

*Now*
During the first week a first draft of a social contract was created containing specifications such as; members and email addresses, meeting schedule, rules on attendance, responsibilities and roles, time log policy, documentation policy and ambition levels.

*Goal*
Since we are currently lacking information regarding the project, we were unable to complete the social contract. Next week we will therefore add new roles and responsibilities and more detailed description of scrum rules and sprint techniques. 

*Gap*
To be able to fill this weeks information gap we need to attend lectures on scrum techniques and discuss our take on it. We will also review the course literature to see if we can find more information on working with scrum. By attending the project introduction lecture (next week) we will hopefully get a fuller picture of the project scope and will then be able to adjust the social contract correctly.

The following points we are not yet able to define since the information hasn’t been reviewed this early in the course. Our goal is to fill in the gaps by attending lectures and gaining knowledge from course literature and information from the project owner:

* **The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

* **Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

* **The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

* **The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

* **The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

* **Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

* **The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

* **Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

**The roles you have used within the team
***Now*
In our first week we have assigned some roles to our team members including Scrum master, secretary for meetings, a casting vote, a chief location officer (CLO). 

*Goal*
To have a relevant task assigned for every member, but still an equal amount of work.

*Gap*
To reach our goal we will have to learn about which relevant tasks that exists in a project of this format and have responsibilities that require somewhat equal efforts for a fair workload. **
**

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

*Now*
In the first week our team had initially limited experiences of agile practices, both about what it is and how it should be adopted in an IT project. 

*Goal*
To get acquainted with and use Scrum during the project. 

*Gap*
We will learn the agile practices by going to the lectures as well as reading literatures about useful practices that we can try and evaluate. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

*Now*
We have created a table where we keep records of the time spent on this course.   

*Gap*
Hard to reach 20h/week in the first week since we haven’t been introduced to the application. This week we have spent the time on lectures and learning git/scrum practices, around 12 hours in total as a group as of thursday, first week. 

*Goal*
Reach 20h/week for every member which will be audited every week.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

In this section we’re considering this weeks LEGO exercise

*Now*
We tried to asses out team velocity and the scope of the user stories.

*Goal*
Our goal is to become better at assessing velocity and scope of the user stories.

*Gap*
Live activity based training (aka learning by doing).

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

*Now*
We have started using GitHub, Git as well as Trello.

*Goal*
Learn how to use the tools efficiently and according to best practices.

*Gap*
Initially learning by doing. Further down the road we will consult online guides and other available resources.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We have not yet had any guest lectures or read any course literature.
