# Indivdual reflection, Filip Wendelin 

## Week 1 

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?

This have been a bad week for me. I’m both been away to Stockholm for job search and I’ve attended a funeral at my childhood home. I will compensate my missed time in the coming weeks.    I’ve unfortunately missed most of the weeks lectures dues to the above. Instead I’ve read about scrum, XP and git on my own to make my start stretch very very short next week.

I want to learn Git better so I’m confident when I handle branches. I also want to try out the scrum technique.

Learning objecting for next week (V.13): Fully understand scrum and Git.

Plan to get there: dedicated work in the right location and better communication with the group, maybe a divide and conquer approach.

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?

First I need to learn what I can learn the team, preferable the scrum technique since it really interest me.

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?

I’ve started to learn what scrum really is and how to implement the framework. I have couple of pages left of the handbook. Then I think I can contribute with my findings. 

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?

This week I’ve started to understand the concepts we are going to use further in the course. Since this has been the first week it’s hard to give concrete example. It will be easier when we’ve started with the project for real.


## Week 2

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?

* Fully understand how the shipping industry works, escpiaclly the pilot roles since that is our main topic. 
* Understand the purpose of portableCDM and its code. 
* To understand the app code I've to learn about the API and maybe Javascript. 

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
* Since I've read pretty much about Scrum since last week I contribute in the discussion about what scrum is, how we should implement it and maybe how to adjust it (even if that is not "scrum") for our purpose and situation. 
* By reading the sourcecode of the App and scenario carefully I can help understand what we are going to do and starting to create user stories and a produkt backlog. 

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
By reading The Scrum Guide and different scrum litterature I have contributet to fully understand what Scrum really is and how it is used. I've been thinking how we should solve the daily scrum in a good way since all in the group have different time frames. Will hopefully come up with a good alternativ for next sprint (this is goal).

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?
* I'm starting to feel confident about using git/github thanks to the group, different internet guides and trail and error. Now I can inspect and make sure the git is working fine. 
* A better scrum practice 


### Objectives 
Last week objectives: 
* Learn git and scrum - that is something I've achieved since last week. 

Next week objectives: 
1. understand terminology about testing and software quality (inspired by the lecture).
2. understand the code for the portableCDM app, the API and Javascript. I want to be able to make changes confidently. 
3. understand the port system and especially pilots. 
And share the above to the team.
4. Come up with a solution for daily scrum 


Plan to get to next week's objectives:
1. Read, think and summarize key points
2. Read and discuss with the group and make sure every team member understand. 
3. Read and discuss with the group. Make a scheme about daily life of a pilot.
4. Read more about scrum and discuss


## Week 3

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?

* How the app works
* To understand the termology of userstories (vertical, that elefant name etc.)
* 

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
* Share how I solved problems that occours for me at the  development environment.
* Share my way of thinking creating user stories 
* Do something and review it in the sprint- 

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
* Shared my summary of scrum 
* Had a presentation explaining key points from my summary 
* Knowledge and a positive attitude

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?
* This week we have'd the same user stories for everybody, so I've helped with that including coming up with user stories. 
* Attended the wednesdays turtorial. 

### Objectives 
Last week objectives: 
1. understand terminology about testing and software quality (inspired by the lecture). - 50% CHECK - put testing on hold until we start with it. 
2. understand the code for the portableCDM app, the API and Javascript. I want to be able to make changes confidently. - CHECK, I can make changes but I want to understand it better. 
3. understand the port system and especially pilots. - CHECK
And share the above to the team.
4. Come up with a solution for daily scrum - CHECK We do it foremost on mondays and wednesdays.

Next week objectives: 
1. Start working properly with user-stories 
2. Understand the app and what we want to change
3. Learn more javascript 


Plan to get to next week's objectives:
1. communication within the group
2. Read and discuss with the group and make sure every team member understand. 
4. See stackoverflow and read the source code for the app 


## Week 4

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?
* My development environment works fine and now it's time to change stuff in the app - exciting to atlast be able to write some code. Good for my motivation with more clear objectives. Earlier sprints have been more of learning and less of doing - which suits me worse. 
* The back end of the application so I can fetch the information I want. 
* A deeper understand of the user perspective of the app - which functions is the best and what is should be changed. I think the product owners (RISE-ppl) know that the best. 

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
* Share stuff I've learnt about react native
* I've participated by attending one of the pilot meeting where I helped interpret what the pilots wanted from the app to perform, and afterward helping to prioritize user stories according to what she said. In that way I hopefully help the scrum team to get a better understanding what could and should be done 

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
* Helping to make sure we actually are doing some kind of scrum accoring to the rules. For instance how we do the review, retrospective and sprint-stuff. 
* Helping by coming up with epics and then breaking them into user stories and tasks 
* Helping how we organize Trello

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?
* I attented the second meeting with the pilot and took and an active part in understanding their point of view toward the app. My gained knowledge from that meeting helped me to see the end users perspective better when we come up with epics, user stories and priorized them. 
* Indirect I started to gain more knowledge about react native so I faster can start to code thi week. 
* Unfortunately I missed the meeting on the monday due to a education for my summer job. And since last week we didn't have any delegated work, I had a hard time to work up my 20h. I need a clear goal to get motivation and I was bad of setting one last week. Much for easy this week when we start with coding and actually come up with something visiable. 

### Objectives 
Last week objectives: 
1. Start working properly with user-stories - DONE 
2. Understand the app and what we want to change - ALMOST DONE - will continue with this goal the coming week as well. We didn't get to meet with the product owners from RISE, hopefolly they have time to talk with us this week. 
3. Learn more javascript - NOPE - but I've learnt a lot more about react native. 

Next week objectives: 
1. Understand the app and what we want to change
2. Create a product (I'll be working on how we can handle subscribed portcalls) 
3. Be able to create working code piece with react native. 

Plan to get to next week's objectives:
1. communication within the group
2. Pair programming
3. See stackoverflow and read the source code for the app 
4. Trial and error 


## Week 5

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?
Understand how the app works - how do different views correlate with each other, how do they communicate. 
In order to do that, I need a better understanding of javascript. 

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
We are pair programming, and I’m programming with Anton. I will try to make sure we both understand how the stuff we change work and the understanding behind it. Me and Anton can also help other pair programmers with our mistakes to make the process for everybody more smooth. 
If I learn javascribt better, I can help my fellows more. 


### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
Attending the meeting and helping to make sure we actually are doing some kind of scrum accoring to the rules. For instance how we do the review, retrospective and sprint-stuff. 
Using Trello in a suitable way 
Working on my user story and trying to finish it (my role a developer in the team)  
As our scrum master had to leave on wednesday, I took his part in the scrum of scrum. There i took up the question about a chat-function between the actors. No one had the plan to develop even though some end users might appropriate it (we are probably not either implement it, since we focus on a specific view to the pilots instead). 

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?
*Worked on my user story that is about to fetch data about all berths that are among the favourites. Later that will be implemented in the Gantt scheme so we can show the PO our achievments. 
Spend resonable time (20h isch) doing my user story 



### Objectives 
Last week objectives: 
1. Understand the app and what we want to change - HALF DONE. Understand what we want to change, but not the app totaly. 
2. Create a product (I'll be working on how we can handle subscribed portcalls) - NOT DONE, started, but everything take longer time than you thing. 
3. Be able to create working code piece with react native. - DONE. Can create new text views, write stuff to the console etc. 

Next week objectives: 
1. Get last week user story done. 


Plan to get to next week's objectives:
1. Read code
2. Pair programming
3. Google 
4. Trial and error 

## Week 6

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?
I want to understand the backend of the app better, more precisely I want to fully understand how the where and how the portcalls are stored, and also if there are two different storing areas for favorited portcalls and the one that are ordinary. By doing that, I will be easier to fetch the data we need, like ETA:s and statuses on vessels. I also want to improve my estimation of tasks and user stories since we’ll start with a new KPI about that this week. Though I believe that is very much about gut feeling. 

I also started looking on different code testing methods. That’s an area I want more knowledge about if we have time to do it the last sprint. 

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?

Me and Anton finished with our user story last sprint where we created an array with all the  favouritezed PortCalls to our view. Since we got a little hang of it how it could be done, this week we will help another pair that caught problem with fetching data from a portcall/portcallID. In that way, we can contribute by what we did and what we tried. 
I also took initiative to ask Pontus (tech support) questions that provided help for the entire team. 


### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
Keeping attending all meetings, talking to the productowner etc. I take part of discussions, like this week when we created a new KPI about precision of estimation of tasks. I also made sure that our definition of done would be the best way possible - I want a concrete results that can be shared among the team, and not just “Now I understand how it works” since it’s hard to spread the knowledge. Also contributing by writing and discussion about the retrospective. 



### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?
I worked my hours and I did my assign user story. Since my user story ended when I had some working time left, I started to look on how we can test the code with a third part library like snapshot with JEST. I started a discussion about how we should look on the testing, and that we probably should prioritise coding for the app instead, since the PO:s are not going to use our code immodesty, but want our ideas. There it creates more value by coding what we think.  



### Objectives 
Last week objectives: 
1. Get last week user story done. - DONE. Creates a nice feeling in the gut. Thanks to Pontus it took a lot less time than we thought - we had no idea we were working with react redux as well. 

Next week objectives: 
Get my assigned user stories done
Understand Javascript better (which I’m doing every week)
Think about how long it takes to do the user stories (and tasks) in order to improve it and for the new KPI. 


Plan to get to next week's objectives:
1. Read code and trial and error. 
2. Pair programming
3. Be conscious about the time for each task and if it can get more efficient.
