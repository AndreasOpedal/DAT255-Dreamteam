# Indivdual reflection, Filip Wendelin 

## Week 1 

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?

This have been a bad week for me. I’m both been away to Stockholm for job search and I’ve attended a funeral at my childhood home. I will compensate my missed time in the coming weeks.    I’ve unfortunately missed most of the weeks lectures dues to the above. Instead I’ve read about scrum, XP and git on my own to make my start stretch very very short next week.

I want to learn Git better so I’m confident when I handle branches. I also want to try out the scrum technique.

Learning objecting for next week (V.13): Fully understand scrum and Git.

Plan to get there: dedicated work in the right location and better communication with the group, maybe a divide and conquer approach.

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?

First I need to learn what I can learn the team, preferable the scrum technique since it really interest me.

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?

I’ve started to learn what scrum really is and how to implement the framework. I have couple of pages left of the handbook. Then I think I can contribute with my findings. 

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?

This week I’ve started to understand the concepts we are going to use further in the course. Since this has been the first week it’s hard to give concrete example. It will be easier when we’ve started with the project for real.


## Week 2

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?

* Fully understand how the shipping industry works, escpiaclly the pilot roles since that is our main topic. 
* Understand the purpose of portableCDM and its code. 
* To understand the app code I've to learn about the API and maybe Javascript. 

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
* Since I've read pretty much about Scrum since last week I contribute in the discussion about what scrum is, how we should implement it and maybe how to adjust it (even if that is not "scrum") for our purpose and situation. 
* By reading the sourcecode of the App and scenario carefully I can help understand what we are going to do and starting to create user stories and a produkt backlog. 

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
By reading The Scrum Guide and different scrum litterature I have contributet to fully understand what Scrum really is and how it is used. I've been thinking how we should solve the daily scrum in a good way since all in the group have different time frames. Will hopefully come up with a good alternativ for next sprint (this is goal).

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?
* I'm starting to feel confident about using git/github thanks to the group, different internet guides and trail and error. Now I can inspect and make sure the git is working fine. 
* A better scrum practice 


### Objectives 
Last week objectives: 
* Learn git and scrum - that is something I've achieved since last week. 

Next week objectives: 
1. understand terminology about testing and software quality (inspired by the lecture).
2. understand the code for the portableCDM app, the API and Javascript. I want to be able to make changes confidently. 
3. understand the port system and especially pilots. 
And share the above to the team.
4. Come up with a solution for daily scrum 


Plan to get to next week's objectives:
1. Read, think and summarize key points
2. Read and discuss with the group and make sure every team member understand. 
3. Read and discuss with the group. Make a scheme about daily life of a pilot.
4. Read more about scrum and discuss


## Week 3

### WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?

* How the app works
* To understand the termology of userstories (vertical, that elefant name etc.)
* 

### HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
* Share how I solved problems that occours for me at the  development environment.
* Share my way of thinking creating user stories 
* Do something and review it in the sprint- 

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
* Shared my summary of scrum 
* Had a presentation explaining key points from my summary 
* Knowledge and a positive attitude

### WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?
* This week we have'd the same user stories for everybody, so I've helped with that including coming up with user stories. 
* Attended the wednesdays turtorial. 

### Objectives 
Last week objectives: 
1. understand terminology about testing and software quality (inspired by the lecture). - 50% CHECK - put testing on hold until we start with it. 
2. understand the code for the portableCDM app, the API and Javascript. I want to be able to make changes confidently. - CHECK, I can make changes but I want to understand it better. 
3. understand the port system and especially pilots. - CHECK
And share the above to the team.
4. Come up with a solution for daily scrum - CHECK We do it foremost on mondays and wednesdays.

Next week objectives: 
1. Start working properly with user-stories 
2. Understand the app and what we want to change
3. Learn more javascript 


Plan to get to next week's objectives:
1. communication within the group
2. Read and discuss with the group and make sure every team member understand. 
4. See stackoverflow and read the source code for the app
