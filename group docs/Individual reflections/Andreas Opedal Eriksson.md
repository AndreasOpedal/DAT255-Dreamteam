## Individual reflection week 1, 23/3 ## 

- What do I want to learn or understand better?

To be able to work more smoothly during the project later on, I would like to get a better understanding of Git, GitHub and how they are used together. We have decided to use an application called GitHub Desktop for Git, so I will need to get more used to that as well. I also want to learn more about scrum (which I assume I will during today's lecture) before we start our first real sprint. We have also talked about using a text editor (proposedly Sublime) instead of an IDE for writing code, to make the file management in GitHub easier. I have never programmed in a text editor so I will need to get used to that as well. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can be accessible for helping others when needed and be active in our team discussions to help spread knowledge. As this is the first week, it is difficult to give any examples at this point. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?

My contribution so far has been to participate in the Lego exercise to be able to learn more about how scrum is practiced. I will also attend today's lecture. After that I will be able to have an active role when we discuss and decide upon how we as a group will apply scrum in our project.

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

Right now I am not completely confident with my knowledge of Git and GitHub. My learning objective for next week is therefore to develop a deeper understanding of these. This will be done by reading/studying and learning by doing (as we have already set up a repository in GitHub and tried to figure out how it works with Git)



## Individual reflection week 2, 29/3 ##

- What do I want to learn or understand better?

Right now I want to get a deep understanding of how the PortableCDM app is built and how it works, before we can create content for it on our own. I also want to learn more about the API's used, and get some knowledge about JavaScript as well (if needed) as it seems to have been used for developing the front-end parts of the app. I will do this by digging deep in the source code.

Another aspect I want to understand better is the shipping industry itself, particularly how the process of a vessel arriving to and leaving a port looks like. I will do this by further discussing the "Scenario" with the group and do some research on my own. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As I wrote the last week, I can be accesible for helping others and partake actively in the group discussions. Later when we try to understand the given source code I think I will be able to contribute to the whole group's understanding of the code.

- What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?

This week I have had an active role in trying to figure out how we should structure our sprints, with the complication of having Easter holiday disrupting the schedule. We decided to start and end the sprints on Mondays, which means that our next sprint will start on Monday 9/4 and end on Monday 16/4. So the next team and individual reflections will be uploaded on Monday 16/4. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

Last week my learning objective was to increase my knowledge of Git and GitHub. I think I have achieved this as I am now confident in how the process of downloadning files locally, doing changes in another branch, commiting those changes, pushing the branch to GitHub and then merging the master with the branch works. This objective was achieved by doing testes and figuring it out together with the group.

Next sprint my learning objective is to gain a deep enough knowledge about the app so that I feel confident in adding content and doing changes in the code. This will be done by studying the source code of the application and its API's. 



## Individual reflection week 3, 16/4 ##

- What do I want to learn or understand better?

My focus for this next sprint in developing knowledge will be to learn more about Javascript and the React Native framework that the app is built in. I will gain a basic theoretical knowledge base before I start doing some programming tasks and developing my skills further.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Last sprint I spent some time getting oriented with the app to understand all of its functionality and how it is designed. This will be useful when we try to break down the user stories into tasks, and I can share this knowledge with the group at that point. Further, as I am one of the group members who have gotten the development environment properly up and running I can spend more time on reading up on Javascript and React Native in the meantime, which is also knowledge that I can share with the rest of the group.

- What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?

I have partaked in and had an actrive role in all of the scrum meetings so far, which include weekly sprint retrospectives, sprint reviews and sprint plannings as well as the more frequently occurring daily scrums. I have also helped develop the KPI's. For instance, we decided to change the objective for our overhead KPI from 40%-60% to 30%-50%. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

My contribution towards the team's deliveries has been to complete the sprint's tasks (which this sprint have been common for everyone), help developing the user stories/tasks, attend lectures to gain important insights, attend group meetings and partake in figuring out how to get the development environment working.

- Learning objective

For this sprint my first learning objective is to learn more about Javascript and React Native. My second learning objective is to get a clearer understanding of the pilots' situation to be fully confident in writing user stories and tasks. 



## Individual reflection week 4, 23/4 ##



- What do I want to learn or understand better?

For this week's sprint I want to learn exactly what is needed to complete the task(s) I will complete. This includes learning how to add a new view in the app (for the "GANTT chart" we are going to implement) and how to add a link to this view in the app menu. No further theory on Javascript, React Native, Git, Scrum or anything else is worth the time right now.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

After completing the week's programming tasks, my programming peer and I will explain briefly to the rest of the team how we did, in order to share the knowledge. I can also share some of the knowledge about Javascript and React Native I have acquired through tutorials with the rest of the team if problems that I have the skills to solve show up. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's application of Scrum?

As the previous sprints, I have had an active role in all the Scrum related meetings and team reflections. I have also pushed the team to develop more concrete user stories so that we can break them down into tasks and start doing some value-adding work, which we then did. Further, I have partaked in deciding the structure in Trello related to epics, user stories and tasks, where we now have a color code for each of the three categories and have numbered the different elements according to a MECE structure. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

As the previous sprint, it has been to do my part in completing the tasks (which have up to this point been mainly common for every team member). For this sprint we have however been able to delegate the tasks. My contribution will still be to complete my assigned tasks though. 

- Learning objective

As stated above, learn how to implement a new "view" in the app and access this view from the menu in the app. 



## Individual reflection week 5, 30/4 ##



- What do I want to learn or understand better?

For this sprint, my assigned tasks include displaying information from all timestamps for a given portcall (so that we later can display this information in the GANTT-chart). I therefore want to understand how to do exactly this right now.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

We have divided tasks into groups of two. However, we will all sit together when we write code (mostly). We do this so that we can be easily available to each other if help is needed, which means that I will be open to help out with anything I can during the whole sprint. I will mainly help my peer programming mate understand and move forward, and he will do the same with me.

- What is my contribution towards the team's application of Scrum?

As earlier - been active in all the Scrum meetings. This past sprint my contribution has mainly been to complete my assigned tasks. I was also one of the team members who presented our progress to the PO's and discussed our prioritization of user stories with them. It is also worth mentioning that I have taken responsibility in my role as room booking responsible. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

As above - complete my tasks and help move the whole group forward by prioritizing user stories.

- Learning objective

My learning objective for this sprint is to learn what is needed to complete the sprint's task. 



## Individual reflection week 6, 7/5 ##



- What do I want to learn or understand better?

I currently want to deepen my knowledge about how to fetch data about timestamps from the backend and to translate this into a graphical format in the grid system we are implementing. I also want to get better at estimating User Stories and tasks, as this is connected to a new KPI we are evaluating this coming sprint. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since my peer and I were not able to fully complete our assigned tasks for last sprint (as they proved to take more time than estimated), we decided to share the rest of the tasks with another pair within the team. We will therefore need to share our made progress and knowledge with them, so that everyone is on the same level when we finish the rest of the tasks. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's application of Scrum?

During today's Sprint Retrospective, I helped develop the new KPI about estimation accuracy. We are for this sprint going to put this new KPI on trial and will replace one of the current ones if it works out well. I was also a driving force behind us getting a structured way of using DoD's. I took an active role in the rest of the meeting as well, for example I partaked in planning which User Stories that would be taken on for this sprint and how they should prioritized. A lot of the things I wrote about last week are relevant this week as well. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

To complete my assigned task - which is a requirement for my team mates to implement timestamp information in the grid. 

- Learning objective

To learn how to fetch information from timestamps in the app. 



## Individual reflection week 7, 14/5 ##



- What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn more about testing, as this is something that has so far been done in an ad-hoc fashion in the project. More specifically, I want to learn about the tool DeepScan and how it is used, as it seems like a reasonably complex tool for this project's scope. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can help share the knowledge about JavaScript, React Native and the app that have been learned from Pontus to the rest of the group. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's application of Scrum?

I have this week as well taken an active role in the KPI's. For instance, I was invloved in the decision to the adjustments made to the overhead KPI and decision to keep the estimation accuracy KPI. I have also worked on my assigned US's and taken part in all the Scrum meetings. 

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

Completing my/our assigned tasks of fetching timestamp data.

- Learning objective

Testing and DeepScan.
