# Individual Reflection

## Week 6
- **what do I want to learn or understand better?**

I feel that I do understand react-native a bit more, and my javascript is getting better and better. These are still things that I want to improve on, but I do also feel that I need to improve more on the process. I believe that I know quite a bit about the scrum-process now but I feel that the user story and task thing are things I can improve more on. Especially the estimates. It helps that we do this in group and can discuss, and by just doing more I hope that I will improve.

- **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

We've made quite some progress this week and sprint and I feel that doing pair programming is great. While one is doing some code it is much easier for the other one to spot mistakes which could maybe take some time to find if not found instantaneously. I feel that we help each other a lot this way and will probably be the way I can help someone else except for technical struggles.  

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

I've been present at the meatings and I've pointed out some errors in our user story progress, mostly about having a priority, but also just by giving my point of view. 

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**

This week and sprint we've started to render vertical lines for each our as in a calendar/GANTT-chart and also render a vertical line for the current time which is working. We've also added graphical representation that will be used to present timestamps/port calls so I feel that I now have some understanding about rendering things in react native. Our goal now is to actually not just render a random blue box but actually connect it with a port call and for this I will need to understand states a lot more so that is my goal this week, understanding and hopefully be able to implement something related.

## Week 5
- **what do I want to learn or understand better?**

Last week I wrote that I wanted to improve more at javascript, and by looking a bit on tutorials and the given code I feel that I'm starting to get better with the syntax, but I still feel that react-native is a bit of a mystery with the rendering function. My goal still stands to learn more about javascript, though I will now focus more on react native.
- **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

I did not do a lot this sprint since I was sick and also had some deadlines that our bachelor thesis group had set which is were my focus has been this week. Therefore I wasn't able to see if I could help someone out with the coding, nor be present and explain written code. Next week I will be present and I will be able to explain the parts of the code we've been working to the rest of the team in, hopefully at least.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

As said I was sick and therefore not present at our wednesday meeting, but I was present at monday and tried to, as always give my point of view of what we should be doing and how we should structure the sprint.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**

I wasn't able to contribute much to the team's deliveries this week, but will try to catch up next week. As I did not start any coding, just looking at some of the given code and discussing a bit how we should do the GANTT-chart my goal here also stands, I want to learn more about rendering graphical objects in react native and also get a better basic understanding of how the code works. 

## Week 4
- **what do I want to learn or understand better?**

As we will now start the actual coding, I want to improve and learn more about javascript to be able to complete the User Stories at hand. More precisely I want to learn/understand that which is needed to create a visual GANTT-chart in the application.

- **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

I still haven't got a good understanding of the given code, but as we are starting to code this next sprint I will hopefully be able to improve that knowledge and share it with the team.

While creating the structure for the GANTT-chart I will also need to tell each and every member of my group what I have done to make the structure for the GANTT-chart.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

I have been present and given my thoughts during the scrum meetings and team reflections. I have also been present and helped the group develop new User Stories and give my thoughts on the structure of our Trello boards.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**

I have been present at all meetings and given my thoughts in discussions. Until this point we have mostly done the same thing, but now when the coding starts I hope to be able to contribute this way this coming sprint. As the group has chosen to try to implement a GANTT-chart into a new view I hope to be able to learn more about this, both adding new graphical elements (views, GANTT-timeline) and also more about how the application works. 


## Week 3
- **what do I want to learn or understand better?**

I feel like I start getting a good understanding of Scrum now, and I think the lecture on friday (2018.04.13) did help to bring some new perspectives. I have also, with the help of my group, got Android Studio working and have been looking at some basic javascript code, the next step is to understand the structure of the given code, some things are quite clear, like changing some strings or color, but I still need to understand the code a lot more to actually contribute in the end.

- **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

We haven't started programming yet so there has been no pair-programming which I mentioned last week. The plan is to start next week and I hope that by looking over the code I can help the rest of the team to understand the code as well. I will also probably get help to understand some of the code from other team members. We have to help each other so that we all can do as much as possible in the time given.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

I do not think I do a lot to contribute except taking part in the meetings and discussions, though I believe this is what I am supposed to do.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**

I have been present at all meetings giving my point of view, asking questions at the supervision, taking notes and trying to understand the work of the pilots in the harbor. I have started to look over the code and hope that I will be able to contribute more this way when we start programming.


## Week 2
- **what do I want to learn or understand better?**

Last week I said that I wanted to learn more about Scrum and Git and I do feel more confident in these now, especially Git/GitHub Desktop, but I do have more to learn about Scrum. I also want to understand the project a bit better by looking at the given code and by doing some reading about the project.

- **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

We haven't done much yet except planning and discussing the assignment, but as said last week I do hope that I will be able to help some/someone by doing pair-programming when we actually start working. Same with Scrum, I hope that I can contribute to our usage of Scrum so that everyone learns how to use it, including myself.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

Since we're still in an early phase of learning to use Scrum it is hard to say what my contribution is at this moment, except that I try to participate in discussions and communication.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**

Last week I wrote about the project, Git and Scrum and I feel that I have more information on all of these subjects now than I had last week, which shows progress. As said earlier, I have tried to participate in the meetings and discussions and that is my contribution this far, I have also created a Google Sheets document where we can document our progress for our KPIs

## Week 1
- **what do I want to learn or understand better?**

My first goal is to learn Scrum and Git (using Github Desktop GUI) since  these will be used during the whole course.

- **how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

At this moment I feel that it will be hard to help the team to learn something new as I am but an apprentice in Scrum and Git but when the project starts together with the programming I hope I can contribute and teach something new by doing pair-programming. I also hope that by reading the course literature I can help in the discussion of Scrum since I guess most of us are on a similar level and may have different point of views on the technique

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

Not that much at this moment since I my knowledge of Scrum is small and that the course has just started. I also did not take on the role of scrum master at the excerise of 21 of March. But I do hope that I can help in meetings by letting everyone in on the discussion so that everyone gets their say.

- **what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**

Since this week is the first I do not have much do say about progess, but I hope and think that I did contribute to the meeting we had where we assigned roles for the team. For next week I want to understand the project and also, as said earlier, learn to use Git (GUI) and also more about Scrum so that we can use it for as much as possible during the course.
