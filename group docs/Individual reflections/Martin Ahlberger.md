### Individual Reflection week 7

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to perform tests on a graphical view which I think is harder than logical functions. I still want to learn more about the app.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I can help people with my knowledge about programming.  I have been debuging code, solving common problems before and been working with larger projects with many contributors before. I hope that will be useful and I try to teach my group as much as I can.

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in weekly scrum meetings and discussed about possible the change of KPI.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have continued to work on a timeline view and with a little more focus rewriting code to a more sustainable level and trying to make the best use of react's strengths.

### Individual Reflection week 6

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about the app, how the views are binded to each other and use this to get a better understanding about how the different views work. In main I want to understand the code better.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I can help people with my knowledge about programming.  I have been debuging code, solving common problems before and been working with larger projects with many contributors before. I hope that will be useful and I try to teach my group as much as I can.

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in weekly scrum meetings and also discussed a potential change of KPI's. 

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been working on a timeline view which the product owner wanted. I have also helped the other memebers in the group with their development.

### Individual Reflection week 5

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about React Native and how the current application uses it. I would also like to know more about the product since I have spent to much time focusing on technical problems.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I can help people with my knowledge about programming. I have been debuging code, solving common problems before and been working with larger projects with many contributors before. I hope that will be useful and I try to teach my group as much as I can.

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have been participating in the meetings and helped with analysis of our 3 KPI's.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been helping with debuging the teams local environment so the application could run at all. After that I have been working on creating a timeline view.

### Individual Reflection week 4

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
Also this week there have been to much of my time being spent on debuging code which, of course have been useful for my team mates but also, have caused that I lack some knowledge about the domain. I need to catch up about the user stories and the knowledge of the App as I only know the App in vauge technical terms.

I would also need to dig deeper in the App to know how it works on a functional plane, not just building and running it. 

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Until this point a lot of effort from my side has been put on making the app work and run on the team members local environment. From now on it's important to do some development. At this part I think, and hope, that my knowledge as a web developer will come to hand.

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have been practicing at daily scrums and the team's weekly reflection. I have been paticipating in the discussion about how and when we are going to have our sprints.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
There have still been none, or very little, value adding work made by the group. My time have been focused on helping others with their development environment which isn't part of the delivery but will make sure everyone can contribute to theese in the future.

### Individual Reflection week 3

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have learned a lot about the domain but there could still be added more knowledge but I whink that will do when working with the project. I want to learn more how the app work and how it today solves problems for the users. I also want to know more about the developing environment so I can help my group more with their problems running the application and also to understand better when developing.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I still can contribute with my experience of software projects and also my coding skills could be useful.

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have been practicing at daily scrums and the team's weekly reflection.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been active in the research of the domain even though others have contributing more at this part. Instead I have continued to try to fix the developing environment so it primarily works and secondary is easy to work with. Nothing of this has succeeded but I will continue and I'm still learning a lot so I hope it will soon work.

### Individual Reflection week 2

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to learn more about the project, what is expected by for us to complete. We just started the domain research and the domain seems interesting. I would really like to know more about that topic. Since we are going to develop av application for android it's interesting to learn about design best practices, Android SDK etc but I think the time for this project need to be put on actually achieving something that has real value for the product owner.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I still can contribute with my experience of software projects and also my coding skills could be useful. 

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
My contribution in scrum have been about communicating and adressing problems. I still think scrum is hard because there seems to be many ways on how to work and some of the stricted ways dosn't seem to fit our project because we dosn't work in one place all together and not on a daily basis.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have been learing people about git and tried to help in the decision of IDE:s and text editor. I have participated in the meetings where we have discussed domain and technical parts. I would like to participate more in the domain research to try to understand the scope of the project.

### Individual Reflection week 1

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have been using Git a few times before but there is still a lot to learn about it. I also want to know more about Scrum since it's a whole new concept to me but I've heard about it and know it's used at many companies. Of course it would be interesting to know more about the project.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since the knowledge about the project is not so good for any team member we have been working with preparing our knowledges with the tools we should be working with. My biggest ontribution to the team has been to share my shallow knowledge about Git which anyway is bigger than anyone elses.

I also hope my earlier experience in software projects will help the team to do progress and that other can learn something good from me.

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

My contribution this week hardly existed since we don't know so much about scrum yet. I participated in the LEGO excercise which much count as something.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

In my opinion the team hasn't been delivering anything because the project hasn't started yet. So neither did I deliver something. I have been teaching a bit about Git which I think is very complicated but a great tool when it's handled with care.
