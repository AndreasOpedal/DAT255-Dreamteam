# Individual Reflection week 1

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have been using Git a few times before but there is still a lot to learn about it. I also want to know more about Scrum since it's a whole new concept to me but I've heard about it and know it's used at many companies. Of course it would be interesting to know more about the project.

## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since the knowledge about the project is not so good for any team member we have been working with preparing our knowledges with the tools we should be working with. My biggest ontribution to the team has been to share my shallow knowledge about Git which anyway is bigger than anyone elses.

I also hope my earlier experience in software projects will help the team to do progress and that other can learn something good from me.

## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

My contribution this week hardly existed since we don't know so much about scrum yet. I participated in the LEGO excercise which much count as something.

## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

In my opinion the team hasn't been delivering anything because the project hasn't started yet. So neither did I deliver something. I have been teaching a bit about Git which I think is very complicated but a great tool when it's handled with care.
