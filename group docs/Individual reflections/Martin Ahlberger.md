### Individual Reflection week 3

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have learned a lot about the domain but there could still be added more knowledge but I whink that will do when working with the project. I want to learn more how the app work and how it today solves problems for the users. I also want to know more about the developing environment so I can help my group more with their problems running the application and also to understand better when developing.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I still can contribute with my experience of software projects and also my coding skills could be useful.

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have been practicing at daily scrums and the team's weekly reflection.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been active in the research of the domain even though others have contributing more at this part. Instead I have continued to try to fix the developing environment so it primarily works and secondary is easy to work with. Nothing of this has succeeded but I will continue and I'm still learning a lot so I hope it will soon work.

### Individual Reflection week 2

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to learn more about the project, what is expected by for us to complete. We just started the domain research and the domain seems interesting. I would really like to know more about that topic. Since we are going to develop av application for android it's interesting to learn about design best practices, Android SDK etc but I think the time for this project need to be put on actually achieving something that has real value for the product owner.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I still can contribute with my experience of software projects and also my coding skills could be useful. 

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
My contribution in scrum have been about communicating and adressing problems. I still think scrum is hard because there seems to be many ways on how to work and some of the stricted ways dosn't seem to fit our project because we dosn't work in one place all together and not on a daily basis.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have been learing people about git and tried to help in the decision of IDE:s and text editor. I have participated in the meetings where we have discussed domain and technical parts. I would like to participate more in the domain research to try to understand the scope of the project.

### Individual Reflection week 1

#### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have been using Git a few times before but there is still a lot to learn about it. I also want to know more about Scrum since it's a whole new concept to me but I've heard about it and know it's used at many companies. Of course it would be interesting to know more about the project.

#### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since the knowledge about the project is not so good for any team member we have been working with preparing our knowledges with the tools we should be working with. My biggest ontribution to the team has been to share my shallow knowledge about Git which anyway is bigger than anyone elses.

I also hope my earlier experience in software projects will help the team to do progress and that other can learn something good from me.

#### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

My contribution this week hardly existed since we don't know so much about scrum yet. I participated in the LEGO excercise which much count as something.

#### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

In my opinion the team hasn't been delivering anything because the project hasn't started yet. So neither did I deliver something. I have been teaching a bit about Git which I think is very complicated but a great tool when it's handled with care.
