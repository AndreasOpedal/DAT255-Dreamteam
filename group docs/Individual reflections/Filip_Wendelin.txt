- WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?

This have been a bad week for me. I’m both been away to Stockholm for job search and I’ve attended a funeral at my childhood home. I will compensate my missed time in the coming weeks.    I’ve unfortunately missed most of the weeks lectures dues to the above. Instead I’ve read about scrum, XP and git on my own to make my start stretch very very short next week.

I want to learn Git better so I’m confident when I handle branches. I also want to try out the scrum technique.

Learning objecting for next week (V.13): Fully understand scrum and Git.

Plan to get there: dedicated work in the right location and better communication with the group, maybe a divide and conquer approach.

- HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?

First I need to learn what I can learn the team, preferable the scrum technique since it really interest me.

- WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?

I’ve started to learn what scrum really is and how to implement the framework. I have couple of pages left of the handbook. Then I think I can contribute with my findings. 

- WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES?

This week I’ve started to understand the concepts we are going to use further in the course. Since this has been the first week it’s hard to give concrete example. It will be easier when we’ve started with the project for real.
