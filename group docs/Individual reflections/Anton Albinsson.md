## Week 1 ## 

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In the first week I have very limited understanding on which different methods/frameworks are suitable in an agile project.
In the lectures I have heard about Scrum but I am not sure exactly how this concrete will be implemented.
My goal is to learn about Scrum by learning about some concrete examples of what different elements such as a product backlog or user story might look like. 
I want to reach my goal by experimenting with a Trello to customize a board this sprint and add cards that represent items in a real agile project. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I believe that because we as a team have limited experience with using tools such as Trellos one goal could be to help with how Trello can be implemented in our agile project.
To do this it will require me to learn more about the Trello tool and create test boards where we can try different approaches to find out what works best for all of us.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
In this first week my knowledge about scrum is very limited and therefore it's hard to contribute to the team's application of scrum.
I want to help the team's application of scrum by fixing a Trello so we easier view our product and sprint backlogs. 
To do this I can search the web for current best practices of combining Trello with Scrum and adapt to our current project format. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
For this first week it's hard to determine exactly our team's deliveries.
I believe this goal will be more to find out about which deliveries our team will and should have.
To get there I will be part of our group meetings and lectures. 


## Week 2 ## 
 
**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
After the last sprint lectures about scrum and discussions in our group meetings I feel I have a better view of Scrum, for example I have learned the difference between the retrospectrive vs review, even if its ofcourse a lot more to learn.  We have also discussed the implementation of Scrum in our group meetings and I have created a first draft of what it can look like. 

This sprints goal is to learn more about the PortableCDM. I want to better understand how the code architecture iTs as well as how APIs work as I feel it's important to know to avoid double-work in future sprints.  

To reach this goal I will look at the current code of PortableCDM to understand how it works. I believe our group meeting is a good way to discuss things like what its limitations is so we know where we should direct our foucs. For API I will do soem resarch online to get a better picture of it. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
As we have created our first Trello Board and talked about different approaches to adapt scrum in Trello I believe we as a group have learned more about Trellos possibilities and also limitations in applying scrum. 

This sprint I want to help our team by reading the scenario and be involved in group mettings to take a active role in sketching the workflow of the pilot organization so we can learn about which aspects is important of the pilot organization. This will help use create better user stories that are focused on the pilot organizations view. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I believe that the Trello Board created have helped us be better prepared to implement scrum in our workflow process.

As I showed the team there are several apporaches to set Trello + Scrum. This sprints goal will be to test one of the approaches and see if it works or if we should try another one. This will be done by being active in our group meeting, especially in our retrospective. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
As we have met the product owners and had group meetings I believe we have a better picture of our deliveries.

This sprint goal will be to further break down this deliveries by setting up user stories. I want to contribute by reading more about the scenario and be active in group meetings to find the workflow of the pilot organization. 

## Week 3 ##

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In retrospective I realized that setting up the developer enviroment was much harder than anticipated. As I still have not made the developer enviroment work (Android Studio), I still feel that I lack understanding of how the code architecture works. 

This sprints goal will therefore be revised to first setting up the developer enviroment correctly, e.g. can run the app without problems in android studio. Depending if I am achiving this, another goal will be to edit some of the exisiting code, as I believe this is a good way to learn more about how the code architecture works.

To achieve my goal I will discuss my problems with our group, I will search the web for forums were similar issues have been posted and I will also post my problems in the DAT255 slack channel. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
In our group meetings we was able from the sketch of the workflow create a bulletin list over the pilot organizations workflow, which gave us a better overview of the pilot organizations role. 

This sprint I believe that we all will have to learn more about react-native in order to be able to code in the future sprints. As such, I want to educate myself about this framework by watching tutorials on youtube, and then hopefully be able to help someone by sharing this information I have learned. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Besides taking part of our group meeting and attending the lectures, as my role as Trello responsible I had helped my team by adjusting our Trello Board to help our agile practices. For example, one of our KPI's is focused around comparing our velocity vs actual time of user stories completed. As such I have recommended the extension Scrum for Trello which helps easier input time spent on each user stories. In our group meeting we also came to the conclusion that we should try the approach of 1 board for each sprint. 

This sprint goal will be to establish some rules for how we are allowed to move user stories in our board. For example, when and whom can move a user story from the testing to done coloumn. Having a set of rules will make it easier for us to make fair comparissons on our actual achivments, which is important if we want to create a better process in our group. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
This sprint we as a group has had group meetings where we discussed the scenario and drafted user stories. Our group also met with the pilot organization which helped us with some prioritizations of our user stories. 

The goal of this sprint is to alter our user stories to better fit the product owners needs and take input to be able to put priority levels on our user stories. I also want to be part of splitting up a user story into tasks so we are enabling us to start coding which will help our deliveries by showing something concrete to our proudct owner next sprint. 

## Week 4 ##

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In retrospective I have achived my goal of setting up the developer enivroment but have very little experience with the coding part. 

This sprints goal will be to learn more about coding in Javascript with React Native framework as well as how to work effectivly in a pair when programming. 

To achieve my goal I will, together with my colleague in pair programming, try to code one of our user stories. I believe I will learn alot about js/react for just doing some practical work involving code but also be active with my colleague and ask this person for any tips regarding js/react. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
After watching several tutorials on youtube last sprint I gained somewhat knowledge about js/react even though I feel the need for coding in order to get a better understanding so I did not reach last sprints goal exactly.

This sprint I believe my goal will still be to help someone learn more about react-native/javascript but this week it will be focused around my colleague whom I will be doing the pair programming with. I want to reach this goal by summarizing my findings from the youtube tutorial as well as reading on the web about similar components that we can take inspiration from. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
How to make an effective flow of our user stories in our board is still a hard question. Some of the suggestions for solving this flow is to 1) break down a card holding a user story involving several tasks to multiple card containg one card each and 2) setting up a clear definition of done & acceptance critiera. Since we can't plan for everything in advanced, one way of application scrum is here to test one week and then in our retrospective see how our process was affected. 

This sprints goal will be to make a clear and meaningful seperation in our Trello Board between Epics, User Stories and Tasks. Achiving this will require to take use of different elements in trello such as multiple lists and labels, but also to listen closely to the group members for what they find most practical to use as nothing is value-adding of its own. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
I have attended group meetings in this sprint where we have created user stories and made some intitial prioritizations. 

Goals of this sprint will be to take one of the user stories in our sprint backlog, and together with my colleague, implement this in code to help our deliveries. To do this we will have to break down our user stories into tasks and then start working on coding.

## Week 5 ##

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In retrospective I have learned more about coding in Javascript with React Native framework and realized the importance of start coding without planning to much in advanced. Pair programming went fine. 

This weeks goal will be, besides more coding, to get a better grasp about how the different components in the app communicate with each other. I believe this is important because a lot of the code can be reused if you only know where to look. Achiving this goal will be made through 1) trial-and error in the code to see where changes appear and 2) making a simple sketch of some of the components that will be intresting for our user story. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
In retrospective I realized that "summarize my findings in the javascript tutorial" and show to my pair programmer was a bad goal because most of it would never be used. I did however believe that we could share some ideas with each other. 

As we are currently exploring the code if I come across some useful functions/components I want to tips other groups about these so they can learn about them and apply it when coding their user stories.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Last sprints goal about using our Trello Board to seperate between Epics, User Stories and Tasks went really well. We now use a board for storing our epics + product backlog and then a seperate board for each sprint. We use the task-list function to integrate our tasks into each user story. 

This weeks goal will be to try to find improvments to our Trello setup, as an important part of the scrum retrospective part to evaluate the process. To do this I will combine asking the team combined with trying to find out which area that eventually might need another setup than current "best-practice", to suit our needs. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
While we broke down our user stories into tasks we were not able to fully code our complete user story during last sprint. Reflecting on this I believe that it's important to realize the vast uncertanity that exist when approaching a new progamming language and to take this into account during the next time estimation. 

My goal this week will to finish our assigned user story that we were not able to complete last sprint about fetching favorite portcalls. To achieve this goal I will alter my apporach and focus more on reusing exisitng code but also ask for help from our other team members as they might have done something similiar during coding of their user stories. 

## Week 6 ##

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In retrospective I learned the importance of reusing our the exisitng code base which helps save a lot of time. The sprint involved some trial and error as well as useful tips from Pontus during the wednesday. By this I gained a better understanding of how components communicate, for example learned more about the role of react redux, which I hardly believe I would know if I just watched youtube tutorials. 

We have started coding on different user stories and sooner or later we will need to integerate these so they communicate with each other. This weeks goal will therefore be to learn more about how this process actually works in practice and what challenges that arises when different people have written codes that need to be consolidated. This knowledge will be attained by being active during our group meetings and possibly when testing/reviewing someone else code. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
Last sprint we were for example introduced to React Redux and in our team we helped each other trying to get a grasp about it and its purpose, which I found very useful. 

This sprint we will team up with another programming pair to help solve a user story. Here I hope to be able to provide the insights me and my pair programming buddy learned from our user story last sprint so we can complement each other sprint. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
We learned last sprint that in order to better be able to integerate user stories we need clearer defintion of dones, which was identified as one area where Trellos description box was a good way make it  (DoD) easier accesible. 

This weeks goal wil be to help our team get a better sense of our capabilties of time estimation, which is a important aspect when applying scrum. This will be done by our new KPI (Estimation accuracy) as well as setting up clear rules about our Trello setup where the actual time can be inputed for each task. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
The user story was succesfully completed and went through testing. Leason learned was that the focus reusing code was a smart move as well as asking Pontus for more technical advice. 

This sprint goal will be to finish our user stories on receiving relevant time stamps from our given portcalls. From the leasons learned last week the focus should be on reusing exisiting code as well as taking advice from our different group members as we know have achived more knowledge on different fields. 

## Week 7 ##

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**

In retrospective I learned more about the integration of code when attempting to solve a merge conflict between a feature-branch and the master branch.  I realized that to solve this conflict in a productive way it’s important to know what the other group members are working with, which made me understand the value of daily scrums even more. 

This sprints goal I want to learn more about the testing of code process. Both on a practical level in how to implement testing programs for our code but also what a testing programs actually look for and what must be complemented by code reviewing by a pair. I took on a user story this during this sprint planning about testing procedures where I will review some of the testing programs mentioned in the DAT255 slack channel. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I believe by working with another programming pair in the last sprint, we could share some knowledge between the teams which helped us in our approach on the user story. 

As I took on a user story focused around how to implement testing programs into our existing code base, I therefore want to help the rest of the team to learn more about how testing works and what it’s purpose is. I will achieve this goal by acquiring knowledge myself of different testing programs and after that present my findings to the rest of the group during either a group meeting or as some sort of cheat sheet. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Last sprint I took an active role by creating our new KPI, Estimation Accuracy, and defined it as the average of the absolute deviation between actual and estimated time. Furthermore, there are now clear rules for how to input the actual time into a Trello Card. 

A goal of this sprint will be to follow up on the Estimation Accuracy KPI, to see if the introduced inspection is contributing to us adapting into better time estimation. While it would be optimal to have had data for all this sprints weeks, I believe comparing this sprint result to last would still be interesting to see. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
Last sprint the user stories on receiving relevant time stamps were not quite completed, even though we managed to complete some of the tasks which helped us getting closer to completion. 

A part of this week’s goal will be to complete the testing procedure user story. As we are approaching deadline for this project we need to get the application to work as intended. I therefore also want to take an active role in our group meetings to listen to any needs of help where I could contribute to complete said user story.  


## Week 8 - FINAL ##

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
At the beginning of this project my approach to learning has always been to set up a detailed plan for the upcoming weeks and then stick to the plan until I achieve my goal. Therefore, I experienced it quite as a shock when facing all the uncertainties which exists in this project. 

Initially I learned about all the different Scrum elements but after that I didn't know where to put my focus. Here I learned that our group meetings (with sprint retrospectives & planning) was really useful to realize what was actually important to learn this week and to not worry as much about what would happen in a month or so. This is reflected in my learning objectives which has spanned from in the beginning to gain PortableCDM knowledge when we need to created ideas for epics and later towards a focus on developer environment/React Native when our project hit the coding stage. 

As this was my first real time trying to build upon an existing code base I realized the importance of reusing code and this was represented by a shift in learning objectives from generic ReactNative tutorials to start playing with the code and to learn more specifically about those components that are useful to our US (user stories).

This was also my first time being part of larger group working towards a common goal which was reflected in my learning objective to understand the integration of different branches. By having this objective, I learned about importance of "Definition of Done" and how to solve a merge conflict. 

In the final sprint my goal was to find out more about the testing procedures. Here I learned that different programs as DeepScan versus JEST has different purpose and requires different amount of effort to implement. 

My main goal for future project will be to practice what I have learned about not having a static long-term planning and instead embrace uncertainty and prepare to adapt to new changes. To achieve this goal, I will have to involve more frequent reviews of my process to understand my current position. I must also take an active role to receive feedback in order to know what alignments must be made to meet the project goals. To tackle the uncertainty my focus will be on testing different approaches, analyze results and thereby learning more about how the action-consequence relation might look like. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
At the beginning of the project I took on the role as Trello Responsible which resulted in a learning objective to help our team get started in Trello, which took some time but as time matured the group became more comfortable in using it.

As we were approaching the coding stage of the project I initially had a learning objective to summarize my findings of online tutorials on JavaScript/React Native to help my pair programming colleague. In retrospect this was a rather bad goal because since I did not know what was relevant most of it would never come in to use and there was no clear definition of when it was done or how long it could actually take. 

As the project progressed our programming teams learned about different aspects in the code base. During this phase the group faced a particular difficult user story that we put two programming teams on. Here I focused my learning objectives on helping the other programming team understand the purpose of the components we had interacted with, which was a much better goal than the general summarization of online tutorials. 

During this final sprint I was able to help the group learn about testing procedures presented in a cheat sheet. During our group meetings I also spoke about the pro's and con's of different testing programs, so if anyone will continue working in software project they will be aware of their existence. 

Even though I barely scratched the surface around testing procedures I realized the vast importance of catching code errors early before they become huge headaches. Towards future project I want dive deeper into testing and be able to help team members in creating good testing procedures. If I want to help other people, my first priority must be to learn more about the subject. Thereafter I believe in an agile approach to experiment by trying different testing routines, reviewing them and then successively finding one that fits the team.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
As the Trello responsible my focus has been, besides of course being active in our group meetings and providing input, to create a Trello board that enable us to practice scrum in an efficient way. Early in the project this included setting up some simple rules to the Trello Board and explaining some basic functionality. After setting up the board I was faced with uncertainty in how the separation between Epics, US and tasks should be implemented in Trello as no definite answer existed. Here I used the scrum methodology and told the group we would try a particular setup for one sprint, and during the sprint retrospective I would bring up the subject and ask for the groups input and then make some small alterations of the board if necessary. 

To have a successful scrum implementation it is important that we put a reasonable amount of US in our sprint backlog, not too few and not too many. This puts pressure on the estimation accuracy. During our retrospectives we had a hunch that our estimation capability might be impacted of both over and under estimations. To solve this issue, I presented an idea of an Estimation Accuracy (KPI), which would both create incentives for inputting time spent on tasks as well as help realize any eventual problems in our estimation. 
As my goal for this final sprint was to follow up on the Estimation Accuracy KPI I can conclude that we see a small improvement. Furthermore, this more granular representation shows a story that most US was in fact overestimated. 

In successfully implementing Scrum I believe that certain tools could ease the implementation and augment the positive sides. When working in future project I therefore want to contribute in the application of Scrum by setting up & customizing the right tools, for example Trello. To achieve this, I believe that moderation is key, since introduction of everything at once has the risk of information overload as well as it’s difficult to find out which tools that actually provide value.

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
My contribution to our team deliveries has been a mix of focus on US towards the product owner as well as US that helps us as developers. I, together with Filip, formed a pair programming team with focus on fetching the right information which would then be displayed in our graphical pilot timeline view. This required us to dig deep into the codebase to understand how the interaction between different components works, which was harder than anticipated. After managing to filter out relevant portcalls we teamed up with another pair programming team to extract the right information from our selected portcalls. We managed to successfully complete this US as well as coordinating with the other pair programing teams to create a product that we felt got much appreciation from the different stakeholders in this project. 

My contribution to improve our internal process as developers has been targeted at creating an efficient Trello setup as well as providing testing procedures for quality checks around our produced code. This last sprint I was able to contribute towards our deliveries by testing our code and together with other team members we were able to correct some of the issues that arise during the testing process.  

During this project I have realized the importance of cooperation in order to more efficiently create deliveries. Therefore, a goal for future project will be to become better in collaborating with various members of different skillsets. I want to achieve this by more frequent take interest in other peoples current progress so I know any problems/knowledge they might have as well as clearly communicating my current situation.
