## Individuell reflection

**v8, final reflection**

what do I want to learn or understand better?
During this course I have had many different learning goals of either a technical character or regarding the application of Scrum. Looking back, I can now say with confidence that I have gained valuable knowledge of what it means to work in a team contributing towards a larger project using Scrum methodology.

Learning how to apply the Scrum methodology, and working in ways that others have previously identified as best practice (such as working during fixed times and close together to promote information sharing) has been a learning experience that -more than any previous course- has been applicable to actually working professionally within the IT field. I now feel comfortable in saying that I can apply the Scrum framework when assigned to a new development project. Getting familiar with the terminology, such as Sprints, reviews and retrospectives, daily scrums, Scrum of scrums, velocity etc etc, has removed the barrier to entry which would otherwise have had to be overcome at a later point in a career within IT. This course has also provided the foundation for filling the other roles that we have encountered (or taken upon ourselves) within the course, in a more competent manner (ex: Product Owner, developer, scrummaster).

For the technical aspects, learning how development of a frontend application is done, and how it is tied together with a backend database, has been very interesting, and has been a long standing ambition to learn on my own prior to this course. Learning about react native, redux, and the language javascript, has been a large step towards getting a more well rounded experience of programming, and more specifically, how apps are made.

For the future, I would like to test and solidify the knowledge gained by building an app similar to the one in the project, from the ground up, together with a team of developers and using the Scrum process. The purpose of this goal is to gain further confidence in my skills and abilities in this arena.

In order to do reach this goal, I will need to find a suitable next project. As a summer intern within the IT field for this summer, I will have many opportunities to join teams working on similar projects that could help me reach this goal, with the effect of reinforcing what I have learned in the past months.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By providing the governing structure surrounding the application of Scrum that ensured that we on set dates and times meet and work together, each team member has been able to in an efficient way provide the different parts of the puzzle of successfully applying Scrum. When team members contribute with their own pieces of knowledge and experience to the team and the process, we increase the speed of learning as we share information. We have logged our KPI's, how we spend our time, and integrated velocity estimations vs actual time into our Trello board. My specific technical knowledge of shipping, and how the different actors come together in a port call, was early on my main contribution. It helped us decide on a hypothesis and kept us on a straight trajectory with an agreed purpose for what our app should do. Through my knowledge we could maximize the potential of our meetings with the end user, and understand their needs. We could then take this to the product owner for approval. It was also a learning experience for myself to fill this kind of role where I had a fair amount of knowledge and experience of a specific area that I needed to share with the rest of the group to reduce our truck factor.

A future goal for helping others to learn is to improve my ability to see my knowledge from the perspective of my team mates. I want to improve how I synthesize the value of my experience so that I can present it in a coherent and unbiased way. The purpose of this goal is that I want to become a better teacher, and a better interview subject. I feel that I too easily introduce the bias of my professional perspective into the information I provide others (in this case a communications perspective, meaning that I think alot in terms of size of a payload, different information carriers etc etc, which has little value in most contexts for the team).

In order to achieve this goal, the next time someone wants to learn something from me, I need to mentally put myself in their position, and think about the context of their questions, to see what is relevant and what is not.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Throughout the course, I have enjoyed building up the framework of documentation, and establishing the work routines, that help guide and shape the work of the team so that it for every passing sprint more and more conforms to the Scrum methodology.

Examples of this includes creating the documentation for our meetings, so that we have ready-to-go algorithms with meeting points that ensures that all points of a sprint review, sprint retrospective etc is done in the right way. I have made sure that the agile process of improvement within the team has been logged, and that our decisions are saved so that we can easily backtrack when we want to know why/when we made a certain decision during the course of the project.

This final week, my contributions consisted building the presentation material, as well as presenting our work, to the product owners and other stakeholders.

In the future, I want to try on the role of Scrummaster, the purpose of this goal is to get a more holistic view of the Scrum process, and the participation in Scrum of Scrums and the collaborative efforts those meetings strive to coordinate.

To fullfil this goal, I will apply for the role of Scrummaster in my next project having the effect that I also must do my very best in order to not hamper the potential of my team, and rather try to help the team members maximize their own potential.




**v7**

what do I want to learn or understand better?
Learning about props and states in the previous sprint has helped the understanding alot.
In the next sprint I want to understand how events, states and portcalls relate as this is central to our user story. We have previously learned that everything is based on something called Redux, and now that I have a basic understanding of props/states, I will revisit this in order to understand everything at a deeper level.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I believe that through our pair programming excersises I can contribute a different perspective on problems we face and it helps us advance more rapidly. We are combining a trial and error approach with looking through existing code, trying to solve as much as we can - and for the things we get stuck on we try to gather as many questions as we can - in time for each Wednesday consultation time.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
In the previous sprint we were assessing a new KPI, and considering what we should do with our existing "Overhead"-KPI. I contributed to the discussion of whether or not the KPI should be removed, leaning towards keeping the KPI as there are other beneficial effects. The suggestion is now that we redefine so that it is clear what the goal of the KPI is. I suggested "Tidsdisposition" as it shows how we spent the time. The new metric then could be how many of the members have filled in how they spend their time. This way we make use of the info in the logbook in our scrum-process and lifting it from the logbook into our KPI's in a directly useful way, by making sure everyone is doing their part, and logging it. (as the logbook is otherwise just a tool for examiner, for grading/making sure students are contributing equally).


**v6**

what do I want to learn or understand better?

Now that we are up and running and actually trying to contribute to the completion of the different user stories, learning more about Javascript, states and props is a priority. Coming from a basic understanding of Java, the way Javascripts deals with no types, and how assignments are done is confusing. The goal is to move from confusion to a basic understanding during the next sprint.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
In the previous sprint there was some benefits in sharing the progress between the programming pairs with regards to how we managed to accesss different types of information. By continueing to sit together when we program this process of knowledge sharing can easily be maintained, and I will promote that we keep on working in this fashion. We noted that there was a real benefit of having a definition of done that is clear and agreed on by everyone. It helps us divide our tasks efficiently and we can continue with new tasks during the sprint more easily if we can for certain say that something is done.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

In the previous sprint we increased the amount of tasks of each user story. This made it easier to progress in our work. It did however not end up giving us a better accuracy when trying to estimate the tasks. I am thinking of how changing the standard pattern that we use for estimating user stories will help us. We need to make sure that we abide by the principles that Scrum sets out to a further extent. I believe that my contribution for the coming sprint can consist of assisting other team members in iterating that we need to follow the rules and abide by the processes that we have set out for ourselves, specifically how the order the work is done in when it comes to defining our user stories and splitting them into tasks, and estimating them.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We have had a successful Sprint when it comes to completing work that supports the other functions we are trying to develop. We tracked down and extracted information from a port call and tried to make that information available to the people working on the timeline. What remains is to extract specific information, which we will have to do in the next sprint. This is something that we did not have time to do as we underestimated the time it would take to locate and make use of a Portcall. The consultation time in the middle of the week was very helpful to move us forward here. To start getting better at estimates we have introduced a KPI that measures our estimation accuracy.


**v5**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
Right at the start of the sprint the development was up and running. We had an assessment of our user story set to 24 hrs, but completed it in approx 12 hrs, so there is room for improvement. On the other hand, all the other estimations were wildly optimistic, even when adjusting for the delta between the hours we put in and the expected total work hours of the sprint. For the next sprint I want to increase the granularity of the task breakdown - hopefully this will translate into a more accurate assessment.
The goal is to make a more accurate estimate than the previous sprint.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The previous sprint we tried out pair programming and it worked well.
I hope that by pair programming we will leverage each others strengths in order to progress forward. I suggested the addition to our social contract that we always make sure to tag new tasks on trello - this way the team will help eachother progress as those with easier tasks/more skill can move in and assist other team members.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
For the documentation on our drive I am also trying to migrate our team reflection goals into our weekly meetings to ensure we always push forward with the process. We also had discussions regarding our KPI's and if they are pushing us in the direction that we want. As for now - the three KPIs are satisfactory: Overhead, making sure we keep our meetings to the point, Communication, ensuring that we stay on top of our information sharing, and that we critically reflect on the process of communicating and Velocity, making sure that we take our time estimates seriously and that we actively try to assess the user stories' size as accurately as possible.


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The user story we assigned to ourselves was to create an empty view in the app, accessible from the side menu. This is going to act as a future placeholder for content, most probably the Pilot Timeline, which is the working title of the view. We did this by first trying to copy an existing view and making that accessible through a new button on the menu, then gradually removing content from it until it was blank.


**v4**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
In the previous sprint we underestimated the challenges of getting our development environment running. For the upcoming sprint there are lots of user stories that we have broken down that will need estimations, something that I want to be able to accurately asssess in the future. This sprint will be an opportunity to better understand what kind off efforts are needed and how long things actually take to get done. The previous sprint was both a success and a setback with regards to the development environment. I got it running on the old branch of our github but not on the master. At the moment I can access the login screen of the app but no more. I want to understand what is not working at the moment and move forward so that I can tackle other kinds of problems regarding the coding of the app.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
In the previous sprint I have participated in two meetings with the end user, the pilot. Translating their needs into a vision we can work towards requires communicating on the one hand the end users own description of for what they hope what the app will be, and reading between the lines what actual functionality is required. I hope that by focusing on visuals to orient us in terms of what is needed I can contribute to the teams learning and co-creation of the app for the coming sprint.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
By providing a breakdown of the end users description into several categories or Epics, we have arrived at a GANTT representation of vessels arriving in port, a need for a way to easily communicate and negotiate the different times for activities in the port, and a notification system to help the pilot organizer sort through the incoming information from the system. By helping out with the additional breakdown we had hopes of presenting something to the product owner but they were busy during the wednesday so we have not had a priority from them yet. This is a gap we need to get covered for the next sprint.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
By being  able to take a more active role in our second meeting with the pilot organizations manager, we could confirm the needs that the end users described to us in the first meeting. They are pressing for a "chat"-like function, which we have then discussed in anticipation of the product owners demands as to how it could be implemented. At the moment this has been my contribution, the facilitation of the needs of the end user into our list of wishes/requirements of the end user. My goal for the next sprint is to contribute some actual code for one of our user stories, pending the success in getting my development environment to work, which remains another goal.

**v3**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
The previous long sprint has been full of learnings. We are almost up and running with our development environment. At the moment I need to successfully be
able to start the app from Android Studio now that we have the correct files from avajadi. I want to learn more about React in order to start delivering on
the user stories we are developing.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
For our coming meetings it is suggested I join as an area "expert" due to my knowledge of the maritime sector and the lingo they use. This way I can quickly
minimize the barrier that is introduced by this being a fairly unknown area to most students.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have implemented into our meeting structure what I hope will help us move forward toward our goal each meeting. The sprint goals are now transferred
by me into each meeting document to ensure we are making progress towards those goals.
Monday meetings have been structured to walk us through the process of sprint review/retrospective, sprint planning and daily scrum (we end and start sprint
on mondays as of now)

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
At the moment this has been taking notes during our first meeting with the Pilot Organization. Also making sure that we exit this meeting with the info we need
to build our user stories. Also further improving on our meeting structure.
In the future I will instead be free to actively ask questions during meetings due to my area expertise. Other than that I have brought input to suggesting
fixes to get everyone up and running in the development environment, which I got to work in the previous iteration.


**v2.1**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
The previous week my main goal was to understand the tools better, like Git and Github. Hopefully I will successfully be able to upload this reflection, along with our team reflection without any major hitches.
Our working processes have been slightly refined but much remains to be done. A successful implementation of the Scrum workflow is the next thing I want to learn how to achieve.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have tried to make our meeting structure easy to influence and access so that we can look both at what we have done and what is upcoming for the team.
Due to my previous experience in the maritime sector working with communications on commercial vessels I have extensive experience and knowledge within that area, some of which may be useful to this project.
I do notice however that this experience also gives me major "tunnel vision" when it comes to what I think needs to be addressed during our meetings and I will work on decoupling this "communications perspective" in order to synthesize efficient tidbits of information that are genuinely helpful to the group.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
The meeting workflow (that I am responsible for) is slowly adapting to something that is more closely integrated to the Now, Goal, Gap evaluation process.
My goal is that by highlighting our goals on each meeting, we get reinforcement to our p = mv forward.


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we broke down the timeline of a vessel on approach to Gothenburg, and my contribution consisted of the knowledge I have of this from my previous work.
Insights such as constantly changing ETA:S, ETD:S and ETB:S could provide valuable contributions to our future work.

**v1**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
Starting out the first week I have been introduced to both GitHub and Scrum, tools/frameworks that I have never worked with before, and have no knowledge of.
My goal is to master these tools and that usage of them shall be second nature.
For these first weeks I will attend the exercises held during lectures, and also practice through setting up our project on GitHub to become more knowledgeable on the subject.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week we started out with little knowledge of Scrum/Github. Through the exercise provided we all had some initial practice in working on sprints.
My goal for the team is that we quickly find ourselves in a productive routine through which we can provide value for our stakeholders in the coming weeks.
By highlighting our knowledge gaps, asking all the questions I can come up with, I hope to advance us quickly through the learning curve.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We started out with no experience in the application of Scrum this week.
My goal is to be an active contributor, and to have tried on multiple roles throughout this course.
For this weeks exercise, I took on the role of scrummaster, noting the difficulties of information sharing across groups.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this week our deliveries consisted in LEGO structures of different kinds.
My goal for my contributions is to deliver and that I can bring value through each contribution.
For this weeks exercise I had practice in managing the product owners expectations, and negotiating what is a reasonable delivery with the time constraints we were working under, delivering a smaller part of the User Story that was most important.
