## Individuell reflection

**v5**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
Right at the start of the sprint the development was up and running. We had an assessment of our user story set to 24 hrs, but completed it in approx 12 hrs, so there is room for improvement. On the other hand, all the other estimations were wildly optimistic, even when adjusting for the delta between the hours we put in and the expected total work hours of the sprint. For the next sprint I want to increase the granularity of the task breakdown - hopefully this will translate into a more accurate assessment.
The goal is to make a more accurate estimate than the previous sprint.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The previous sprint we tried out pair programming and it worked well.
I hope that by pair programming we will leverage each others strengths in order to progress forward. I suggested the addition to our social contract that we always make sure to tag new tasks on trello - this way the team will help eachother progress as those with easier tasks/more skill can move in and assist other team members.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
For the documentation on our drive I am also trying to migrate our team reflection goals into our weekly meetings to ensure we always push forward with the process. We also had discussions regarding our KPI's and if they are pushing us in the direction that we want. As for now - the three KPIs are satisfactory: Overhead, making sure we keep our meetings to the point, Communication, ensuring that we stay on top of our information sharing, and that we critically reflect on the process of communicating and Velocity, making sure that we take our time estimates seriously and that we actively try to assess the user stories' size as accurately as possible.


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The user story we assigned to ourselves was to create an empty view in the app, accessible from the side menu. This is going to act as a future placeholder for content, most probably the Pilot Timeline, which is the working title of the view. We did this by first trying to copy an existing view and making that accessible through a new button on the menu, then gradually removing content from it until it was blank.


**v4**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
In the previous sprint we underestimated the challenges of getting our development environment running. For the upcoming sprint there are lots of user stories that we have broken down that will need estimations, something that I want to be able to accurately asssess in the future. This sprint will be an opportunity to better understand what kind off efforts are needed and how long things actually take to get done. The previous sprint was both a success and a setback with regards to the development environment. I got it running on the old branch of our github but not on the master. At the moment I can access the login screen of the app but no more. I want to understand what is not working at the moment and move forward so that I can tackle other kinds of problems regarding the coding of the app.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
In the previous sprint I have participated in two meetings with the end user, the pilot. Translating their needs into a vision we can work towards requires communicating on the one hand the end users own description of for what they hope what the app will be, and reading between the lines what actual functionality is required. I hope that by focusing on visuals to orient us in terms of what is needed I can contribute to the teams learning and co-creation of the app for the coming sprint.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
By providing a breakdown of the end users description into several categories or Epics, we have arrived at a GANTT representation of vessels arriving in port, a need for a way to easily communicate and negotiate the different times for activities in the port, and a notification system to help the pilot organizer sort through the incoming information from the system. By helping out with the additional breakdown we had hopes of presenting something to the product owner but they were busy during the wednesday so we have not had a priority from them yet. This is a gap we need to get covered for the next sprint.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
By being  able to take a more active role in our second meeting with the pilot organizations manager, we could confirm the needs that the end users described to us in the first meeting. They are pressing for a "chat"-like function, which we have then discussed in anticipation of the product owners demands as to how it could be implemented. At the moment this has been my contribution, the facilitation of the needs of the end user into our list of wishes/requirements of the end user. My goal for the next sprint is to contribute some actual code for one of our user stories, pending the success in getting my development environment to work, which remains another goal.

**v3**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
The previous long sprint has been full of learnings. We are almost up and running with our development environment. At the moment I need to successfully be
able to start the app from Android Studio now that we have the correct files from avajadi. I want to learn more about React in order to start delivering on
the user stories we are developing.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
For our coming meetings it is suggested I join as an area "expert" due to my knowledge of the maritime sector and the lingo they use. This way I can quickly
minimize the barrier that is introduced by this being a fairly unknown area to most students.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have implemented into our meeting structure what I hope will help us move forward toward our goal each meeting. The sprint goals are now transferred
by me into each meeting document to ensure we are making progress towards those goals.
Monday meetings have been structured to walk us through the process of sprint review/retrospective, sprint planning and daily scrum (we end and start sprint
on mondays as of now)

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
At the moment this has been taking notes during our first meeting with the Pilot Organization. Also making sure that we exit this meeting with the info we need
to build our user stories. Also further improving on our meeting structure.
In the future I will instead be free to actively ask questions during meetings due to my area expertise. Other than that I have brought input to suggesting
fixes to get everyone up and running in the development environment, which I got to work in the previous iteration.


**v2.1**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
The previous week my main goal was to understand the tools better, like Git and Github. Hopefully I will successfully be able to upload this reflection, along with our team reflection without any major hitches.
Our working processes have been slightly refined but much remains to be done. A successful implementation of the Scrum workflow is the next thing I want to learn how to achieve.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have tried to make our meeting structure easy to influence and access so that we can look both at what we have done and what is upcoming for the team.
Due to my previous experience in the maritime sector working with communications on commercial vessels I have extensive experience and knowledge within that area, some of which may be useful to this project.
I do notice however that this experience also gives me major "tunnel vision" when it comes to what I think needs to be addressed during our meetings and I will work on decoupling this "communications perspective" in order to synthesize efficient tidbits of information that are genuinely helpful to the group.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
The meeting workflow (that I am responsible for) is slowly adapting to something that is more closely integrated to the Now, Goal, Gap evaluation process.
My goal is that by highlighting our goals on each meeting, we get reinforcement to our p = mv forward.


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we broke down the timeline of a vessel on approach to Gothenburg, and my contribution consisted of the knowledge I have of this from my previous work.
Insights such as constantly changing ETA:S, ETD:S and ETB:S could provide valuable contributions to our future work.

**v1**
what do I want to learn or understand better?
Starting out the first week I have been introduced to both GitHub and Scrum, tools/frameworks that I have never worked with before, and have no knowledge of.
My goal is to master these tools and that usage of them shall be second nature.
For these first weeks I will attend the exercises held during lectures, and also practice through setting up our project on GitHub to become more knowledgeable on the subject.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week we started out with little knowledge of Scrum/Github. Through the exercise provided we all had some initial practice in working on sprints.
My goal for the team is that we quickly find ourselves in a productive routine through which we can provide value for our stakeholders in the coming weeks.
By highlighting our knowledge gaps, asking all the questions I can come up with, I hope to advance us quickly through the learning curve.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We started out with no experience in the application of Scrum this week.
My goal is to be an active contributor, and to have tried on multiple roles throughout this course.
For this weeks exercise, I took on the role of scrummaster, noting the difficulties of information sharing across groups.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this week our deliveries consisted in LEGO structures of different kinds.
My goal for my contributions is to deliver and that I can bring value through each contribution.
For this weeks exercise I had practice in managing the product owners expectations, and negotiating what is a reasonable delivery with the time constraints we were working under, delivering a smaller part of the User Story that was most important.
