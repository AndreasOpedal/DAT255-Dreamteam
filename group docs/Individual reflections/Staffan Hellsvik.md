## Individuell reflection
what do I want to learn or understand better?
The previous week my main goal was to understand the tools better, like Git and Github. Hopefully I will successfully be able to upload this reflection, along with our team reflection without any major hitches.
Our working processes have been slightly refined but much remains to be done. A successful implementation of the Scrum workflow is the next thing I want to learn how to achieve.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have tried to make our meeting structure easy to influence and access so that we can look both at what we have done and what is upcoming for the team.
Due to my previous experience in the maritime sector working with communications on commercial vessels I have extensive experience and knowledge within that area, some of which may be useful to this project.
I do notice however that this experience also gives me major "tunnel vision" when it comes to what I think needs to be addressed during our meetings and I will work on decoupling this "communications perspective" in order to synthesize efficient tidbits of information that are genuinely helpful to the group.


what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
The meeting workflow (that I am responsible for) is slowly adapting to something that is more closely integrated to the Now, Goal, Gap evaluation process.
My goal is that by highlighting our goals on each meeting, we get reinforcement to our p = mv forward.


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we broke down the timeline of a vessel on approach to Gothenburg, and my contribution consisted of the knowledge I have of this from my previous work.
Insights such as constantly changing ETA:S, ETD:S and ETB:S could provide valuable contributions to our future work.
