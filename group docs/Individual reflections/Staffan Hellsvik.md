## Individuell reflection
what do I want to learn or understand better?
Starting out the first week I have been introduced to both GitHub and Scrum, tools/frameworks that I have never worked with before, and have no knowledge of.
My goal is to master these tools and that usage of them shall be second nature.
For these first weeks I will attend the exercises held during lectures, and also practice through setting up our project on GitHub to become more knowledgeable on the subject.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week we started out with little knowledge of Scrum/Github. Through the exercise provided we all had some initial practice in working on sprints.
My goal for the team is that we quickly find ourselves in a productive routine through which we can provide value for our stakeholders in the coming weeks.
By highlighting our knowledge gaps, asking all the questions I can come up with, I hope to advance us quickly through the learning curve.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We started out with no experience in the application of Scrum this week.
My goal is to be an active contributor, and to have tried on multiple roles throughout this course.
For this weeks exercise, I took on the role of scrummaster, noting the difficulties of information sharing across groups.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this week our deliveries consisted in LEGO structures of different kinds.
My goal for my contributions is to deliver and that I can bring value through each contribution.
For this weeks exercise I had practice in managing the product owners expectations, and negotiating what is a reasonable delivery with the time constraints we were working under, delivering a smaller part of the User Story that was most important.
