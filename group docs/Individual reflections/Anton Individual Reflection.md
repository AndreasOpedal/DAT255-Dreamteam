## Week 1 ## 

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In the first week I have very limited understanding on which different methods/frameworks are suitable in an agile project.
In the lectures I have heard about Scrum but I am not sure exactly how this concrete will be implemented.
My goal is to learn about Scrum by learning about some concrete examples of what different elements such as a product backlog or user story might look like. 
I want to reach my goal by experimenting with a Trello to customize a board this sprint and add cards that represent items in a real agile project. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I believe that because we as a team have limited experience with using tools such as Trellos one goal could be to help with how Trello can be implemented in our agile project.
To do this it will require me to learn more about the Trello tool and create test boards where we can try different approaches to find out what works best for all of us.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
In this first week my knowledge about scrum is very limited and therefore it's hard to contribute to the team's application of scrum.
I want to help the team's application of scrum by fixing a Trello so we easier view our product and sprint backlogs. 
To do this I can search the web for current best practices of combining Trello with Scrum and adapt to our current project format. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
For this first week it's hard to determine exactly our team's deliveries.
I believe this goal will be more to find out about which deliveries our team will and should have.
To get there I will be part of our group meetings and lectures. 


## Week 2 ## 
 
**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
After the last sprint lectures about scrum and discussions in our group meetings I feel I have a better view of Scrum, for example I have learned the difference between the retrospectrive vs review, even if its ofcourse a lot more to learn.  We have also discussed the implementation of Scrum in our group meetings and I have created a first draft of what it can look like. 

This sprints goal is to learn more about the PortableCDM. I want to better understand how the code architecture iTs as well as how APIs work as I feel it's important to know to avoid double-work in future sprints.  

To reach this goal I will look at the current code of PortableCDM to understand how it works. I believe our group meeting is a good way to discuss things like what its limitations is so we know where we should direct our foucs. For API I will do soem resarch online to get a better picture of it. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
As we have created our first Trello Board and talked about different approaches to adapt scrum in Trello I believe we as a group have learned more about Trellos possibilities and also limitations in applying scrum. 

This sprint I want to help our team by reading the scenario and be involved in group mettings to take a active role in sketching the workflow of the pilot organization so we can learn about which aspects is important of the pilot organization. This will help use create better user stories that are focused on the pilot organizations view. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I believe that the Trello Board created have helped us be better prepared to implement scrum in our workflow process.

As I showed the team there are several apporaches to set Trello + Scrum. This sprints goal will be to test one of the approaches and see if it works or if we should try another one. This will be done by being active in our group meeting, especially in our retrospective. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
As we have met the product owners and had group meetings I believe we have a better picture of our deliveries.

This sprint goal will be to further break down this deliveries by setting up user stories. I want to contribute by reading more about the scenario and be active in group meetings to find the workflow of the pilot organization.
