# DAT255-Dreamteam

This is our Readme.

This project is connected to the course DAT255 at Chalmers, where the group has further developed the application PortableCDM from RISE for the use of pilots in sea traffic management. The project has been ongoing during the fourth study period of the academic year 2018/2018.

Social contract and team reflections can be found in "DAT255-Dreamteam/group docs" and individual reflections can be found in "DAT255-Dreamteam/group docs/Individual reflections/". The final reflection can also be found in "DAT255-Dreamteam/group docs". 

Our code can be found mainly in "DAT255-Dreamteam/App/components/pilot-timeline-view/index.js", but we have also developed in "DAT255-Dreamteam/App/components/side-menu-view/index.js" and "DAT255-Dreamteam/App/navigators/appnavigator.js".
